        "reasoning": "We are to find the ratio of the energy shifts for a muon and an electron due to finite nuclear size in a hydrogen-like atom with a nucleus of atomic number Z and mass number A. The nuclear radius is given by R = r0 * A^(1/3). The energy shift for a 1s state in first-order perturbation theory for a finite nuclear size is given by:\n\nΔE = (2π/5) * (Z^4 e^2 / a_0^3) * (R^2 / a_0^2) * |ψ(0)|^2 correction? \n\nActually, for a hydrogen-like atom, the unperturbed ground state wavefunction for a point nucleus is:\n\nψ_{1s}(r) = (1/√π) * (Z/a_0)^{3/2} * exp(-Z r / a_0)\n\nwhere a_0 is the Bohr radius: a_0 = ħ^2 / (m e^2) [in Gaussian units, but we'll use the expression in terms of fundamental constants].\n\nHowever, note that the Bohr radius depends on the reduced mass. For a particle of mass m in a hydrogen-like atom, the Bohr radius is:\n\na = (4πϵ0 ħ^2) / (μ e^2)   [in SI units]\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let's work in atomic units? The problem doesn't specify, so we'll use the expression in terms of fundamental constants.\n\nThe energy shift for a finite nucleus (with uniform charge density) in the 1s state is:\n\nΔE = (2/5) * (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * (1 / a^2) * (R^2) * |ψ(0)|^2\n\nBut we have to be cautious because |ψ(0)|^2 depends on the reduced mass.\n\nFor the 1s state, |ψ(0)|^2 = [μ^3 Z^3 e^6] / [π ħ^6] ??? Let me derive:\n\nActually, the wavefunction at r=0 for hydrogen-like atom is:\n\nψ(0) = (1/√π) * (Z / a)^(3/2)\n\nand a = (4πϵ0 ħ^2) / (μ e^2)   [SI units]\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 = [1/π] * [Z^3 / a^3] = [1/π] * Z^3 * [μ^3 e^6] / [(4πϵ0)^3 ħ^6]\n\nBut we can express the energy shift in terms of the unperturbed energy.\n\nThe standard formula for the energy shift due to finite nuclear size for the 1s state is:\n\nΔE = (2π/5) * |ψ(0)|^2 * ∫_0^R r^4 dr * (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * (1/R^3) * (3 - (r^2/R^2)) ??? \n\nActually, the perturbation is the difference between the actual potential and the Coulomb potential. For a uniform sphere, the potential inside (r < R) is:\n\nV(r) = - (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * (3 - r^2/R^2) / (2 R)\n\nand outside it is - (Z e^2)/(4πϵ0 r).\n\nSo the perturbation δV = V_actual - V_Coulomb.\n\nFor r < R: δV(r) = V_actual(r) - [ - (Z e^2)/(4πϵ0 r) ] \n= - (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * [ (3 - r^2/R^2)/(2R) - 1/r ]\n\nFor r >= R, δV(r)=0.\n\nThen the first-order energy shift is:\n\nΔE = ∫ ψ* δV ψ dV\n\nFor the ground state, the wavefunction is spherically symmetric, so:\n\nΔE = 4π ∫_0^∞ r^2 |ψ(r)|^2 δV(r) dr\n\nBut since δV(r)=0 for r>=R, we only integrate from 0 to R.\n\nNow, for the 1s state, we can approximate ψ(r) ≈ ψ(0) for r << a, and since R is very small (nuclear size, about 1e-15 m, while a is about 5e-11 m for hydrogen), we can take ψ(r) as constant over the nucleus. This is a common approximation.\n\nSo |ψ(r)|^2 ≈ |ψ(0)|^2 for r in [0, R].\n\nThen:\n\nΔE ≈ 4π |ψ(0)|^2 ∫_0^R r^2 δV(r) dr\n\nNow, we need to compute:\n\n∫_0^R r^2 δV(r) dr = ∫_0^R r^2 * [ - (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * ( (3 - r^2/R^2)/(2R) - 1/r ) ] dr\n\nSimplify the expression inside:\n\n= - (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * ∫_0^R r^2 [ (3/(2R) - r^2/(2R^3)) - 1/r ] dr\n\n= - (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * ∫_0^R [ (3 r^2)/(2R) - r^4/(2R^3) - r ] dr\n\nNow integrate term by term:\n\n∫_0^R (3 r^2)/(2R) dr = (3/(2R)) * (r^3/3)|_0^R = (3/(2R)) * (R^3/3) = R^2/2\n\n∫_0^R - r^4/(2R^3) dr = - (1/(2R^3)) * (r^5/5)|_0^R = - (1/(2R^3)) * (R^5/5) = - R^2 / 10\n\n∫_0^R - r dr = - (r^2/2)|_0^R = - R^2/2\n\nSo total integral = [ R^2/2 - R^2/10 - R^2/2 ] = - R^2/10\n\nTherefore:\n\n∫_0^R r^2 δV(r) dr = - (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * ( - R^2/10 ) = (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * (R^2/10)\n\nSo:\n\nΔE ≈ 4π |ψ(0)|^2 * (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * (R^2/10)\n\nSimplify:\n\nΔE = |ψ(0)|^2 * (Z e^2 R^2) / (10 ϵ0)   [Note: 4π and 4πϵ0: we have to be careful with units]\n\nWait, let me write:\n\n4π * [ (Z e^2 R^2) / (10 * 4πϵ0) ] = (Z e^2 R^2) / (10 ϵ0)   [because 4π / (4πϵ0) = 1/ϵ0]\n\nBut actually:\n\n4π * [ (Z e^2 / (4πϵ0)) * (R^2/10) ] = [4π Z e^2 R^2] / [40 π ϵ0] = (Z e^2 R^2) / (10 ϵ0)\n\nBut in SI units, the permittivity is ϵ0, so we have:\n\nΔE = |ψ(0)|^2 * [ (Z e^2 R^2) / (10 ϵ0) ]\n\nBut note that |ψ(0)|^2 for the 1s state is:\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 = (1/π) * (Z / a)^3\n\nand a is the Bohr radius for the reduced mass μ:\n\na = (4πϵ0 ħ^2) / (μ e^2)\n\nSo:\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 = (1/π) * [ μ^3 e^6 Z^3 ] / [ (4πϵ0)^3 ħ^6 ]   [since a^3 = (4πϵ0)^3 ħ^6 / (μ^3 e^6) ]\n\nTherefore:\n\nΔE = [ (1/π) * μ^3 e^6 Z^3 / ( (4πϵ0)^3 ħ^6 ) ] * [ (Z e^2 R^2) / (10 ϵ0) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/π) * μ^3 e^6 Z^3 * Z e^2 R^2 / [ (4πϵ0)^3 ħ^6 * 10 ϵ0 ]\n\n= (1/π) * μ^3 e^8 Z^4 R^2 / [ 10 (4πϵ0)^3 ϵ0 ħ^6 ]\n\nNote that (4πϵ0)^3 * ϵ0 = (4πϵ0)^4 / (4π) ??? Let's compute:\n\n(4πϵ0)^3 * ϵ0 = (4π)^3 ϵ0^4\n\nBut we can write:\n\n(4πϵ0)^4 = (4πϵ0)^3 * (4πϵ0) = (4πϵ0)^3 * 4πϵ0\n\nBut in the denominator we have (4πϵ0)^3 * ϵ0 = (4π)^3 ϵ0^4\n\nAlternatively, we can express in terms of the Bohr radius for the electron.\n\nNotice that the unperturbed ground state energy for hydrogen-like atom is:\n\nE_0 = - (μ e^4 Z^2) / (2 (4πϵ0)^2 ħ^2)\n\nBut we don't need that here.\n\nWe are to find the ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e.\n\nFor the electron, the reduced mass μ_e ≈ m_e (since the nucleus is heavy, but actually for hydrogen-like we use the reduced mass).\n\nIn this problem, the nucleus is the same for both, so the reduced mass for the electron is:\n\nμ_e = m_e * M / (m_e + M) ≈ m_e   [because M is the nuclear mass, which is much larger than m_e]\n\nSimilarly, for the muon, the reduced mass is:\n\nμ_μ = m_μ * M / (m_μ + M) ≈ m_μ   [if M >> m_μ, but note m_μ = 207 m_e, and M is about A * (mass of proton) and proton mass is about 1836 m_e, so for large A, M is large, but for small A we might have to be careful. However, the problem does not specify, so we assume the standard approximation that the reduced mass is the particle mass (because the nucleus is much heavier). \n\nBut note: the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, m_e, m_μ\", so we can leave the reduced masses as they are? Actually, the ratio might simplify.\n\nSo for the electron:\n\nΔE_e ∝ μ_e^3 \n\nFor the muon:\n\nΔE_μ ∝ μ_μ^3\n\nBut also, the Bohr radius a depends on μ, and |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ μ^{3} as we see.\n\nSo ΔE ∝ μ^3 * R^2   [because the rest of the expression is the same for both particles?]\n\nBut note: R is the same for both, because it depends on the nucleus (same nucleus). Also, Z is the same.\n\nSo the ratio:\n\nΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [ μ_μ^3 ] / [ μ_e^3 ]\n\nBut what are the reduced masses?\n\nμ_e = m_e * M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc)\n\nμ_μ = m_μ * M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nThe nuclear mass M_nuc is proportional to A (approximately). But we are given A and r0, but not the nuclear mass explicitly. However, in the expression for R, we have A, so we need to express M_nuc.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the ratio in terms of the given parameters. Since M_nuc appears in both reduced masses, we can write:\n\nμ_μ / μ_e = [ m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ] = [ m_μ / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / m_e ]\n\n= (m_μ / m_e) * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]\n\nTherefore:\n\n(μ_μ / μ_e)^3 = (m_μ / m_e)^3 * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]^3\n\nBut we don't have M_nuc given. However, the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, m_e, m_μ\". We must express M_nuc in terms of A.\n\nIn nuclear physics, the nuclear mass is approximately M_nuc = A * u, where u is the atomic mass unit. But u is proportional to m_e? Actually, u = m_p (approximately) and m_p ≈ 1836 m_e. But the problem does not give that constant.\n\nAlternatively, note that the energy shift expression we have for ΔE also contains a factor of 1/ħ^6, but that is a fundamental constant. However, the ratio ΔE_μ/ΔE_e should not depend on fundamental constants because they cancel.\n\nBut we have:\n\nΔE ∝ μ^3 * R^2\n\nand R = r0 A^{1/3}, which is the same for both particles.\n\nSo ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nBut we need to express μ_μ and μ_e.\n\nIf we assume that the nuclear mass M_nuc is much larger than both m_e and m_μ, then:\n\nμ_e ≈ m_e, μ_μ ≈ m_μ, so the ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nBut is that true? For the electron, m_e << M_nuc (even for hydrogen, M_nuc ≈ 1836 m_e), so μ_e ≈ m_e.\n\nFor the muon, m_μ = 207 m_e, so for a light nucleus (say A=1, hydrogen), M_nuc ≈ 1836 m_e, which is about 8.87 times m_μ, so the approximation μ_μ ≈ m_μ is not great. For heavier nuclei, it's better.\n\nThe problem says \"express in terms of ...\", so we must include the nuclear mass. But how? We know that the nuclear mass is approximately M_nuc = A * m_p, and m_p is the proton mass. But the problem does not give m_p. However, we can express M_nuc in terms of A and the proton mass, but then we have an extra constant.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says \"fundamental constants\", and m_p is not a fundamental constant? But in the context, we are to use the given parameters.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". So we can use fundamental constants such as ħ, c, e, etc., but also we can use the proton mass? However, the problem does not specify the nuclear mass. But in the formula for the reduced mass, we need the nuclear mass.\n\nWe must include the nuclear mass. The nuclear mass M_nuc is approximately A times the atomic mass unit, and the atomic mass unit is m_u = 1 u. But in terms of fundamental constants, we can write m_p for the proton mass, and then M_nuc ≈ A m_p.\n\nBut then the ratio becomes:\n\n(μ_μ / μ_e)^3 = (m_μ / m_e)^3 * [ (m_e + A m_p) / (m_μ + A m_p) ]^3\n\nBut m_p is a constant. However, the problem does not specify that we should use m_p, but it is a fundamental constant? Actually, the proton mass is a known constant, but in the context of the problem, we can leave it as m_p.\n\nBut the problem says \"fundamental constants\", and m_p is a fundamental constant? In particle physics, the proton mass is a known value, but we can use it.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the ratio without approximating the reduced mass, but we must have M_nuc. Since the nucleus is the same, we can write the reduced masses as:\n\nμ_e = m_e M / (m_e + M)\n\nμ_μ = m_μ M / (m_μ + M)\n\nwhere M = M_nuc.\n\nThen:\n\nΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [μ_μ^3] / [μ_e^3] = [ (m_μ M / (m_μ + M)) / (m_e M / (m_e + M)) ]^3 = [ (m_μ (m_e + M)) / (m_e (m_μ + M)) ]^3\n\n= (m_μ / m_e)^3 * [ (m_e + M) / (m_μ + M) ]^3\n\nNow, M is the nuclear mass. How to express M? We know that M is approximately A times the proton mass m_p. But the problem does not give m_p, but it is a fundamental constant. So we can write M = A m_p.\n\nBut the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". So we can use m_p.\n\nTherefore:\n\nΔE_μ / ΔE_e = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{m_\\mu + A m_p} \\right)^3\n\nBut note: the proton mass m_p is approximately 1836 m_e. However, we should leave it as m_p because it is a fundamental constant.\n\nBut the problem might expect the approximation M_nuc >> m_μ, m_e, but as we saw, for light nuclei this is not valid.\n\nHowever, looking back at the problem: it says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\". We have a closed form.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid m_p. The radius R = r0 A^{1/3} does not give the mass, so we must use the mass explicitly.\n\nAnother way: in the expression for the energy shift, we have ΔE ∝ μ^3 R^2, and R is proportional to A^{1/3}, but the reduced masses are independent of R. So we cannot eliminate M_nuc.\n\nTherefore, we must include m_p.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"fundamental constants\", and m_p is one. So we write:\n\n\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{m_\\mu + A m_p} \\right)^3\n\nWe can write it as:\n\n= \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\cdot \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{m_\\mu + A m_p} \\right)^3\n\nBut this is already simplified.\n\nHowever, in the expression, we have m_p. Is there any way to express m_p in terms of other constants? No, because it is given as a fundamental constant.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"fundamental constants\", so it is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem states: \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". Here we have m_p, which is a fundamental constant.\n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\nBut let me double-check: is the nuclear mass exactly A times m_p? For atomic mass, it's approximately A times the atomic mass unit, which is 1/12 the mass of carbon-12. But the proton mass is approximately 1.007825 u, so for simplicity, we use M_nuc = A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. This is standard.\n\nNow, what about Z? Z does not appear in the ratio? In our derivation, Z cancels out because it is the same for both and appears in the same way in ΔE for both particles. Similarly for r0 and A (through R and M_nuc). But we have A in the expression via M_nuc.\n\nSo the ratio does not depend on Z or r0? That makes sense because the finite size effect for the same nucleus should depend on the reduced mass of the lepton and the nuclear mass, and the nuclear size (which is the same) but R cancels in the ratio because it is the same for both.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is independent of Z and r0. But it depends on A because the nuclear mass depends on A.\n\nSo the final expression is:\n\n\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu (m_e + A m_p)}{m_e (m_\\mu + A m_p)} \\right)^3\n\nWe can write it as:\n\n= \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{m_e}{A m_p}}{1 + \\frac{m_\\mu}{A m_p}} \\right)^3   [by dividing numerator and denominator by A m_p]\n\nBut that might not be simpler.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave it as:\n\n= \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\cdot \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{m_\\mu + A m_p} \\right)^3\n\nBut in the box, we need a single expression.\n\nNow, note that the problem gives m_μ = 207 m_e. So we can substitute that.\n\nm_μ = 207 m_e\n\nSo:\n\n\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{207 m_e}{m_e} \\cdot \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{207 m_e + A m_p} \\right)^3 = \\left( 207 \\cdot \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{207 m_e + A m_p} \\right)^3\n\nBut we can factor m_e in the numerator and denominator:\n\n= \\left( 207 \\cdot \\frac{ m_e (1 + A m_p / m_e) }{ m_e (207 + A m_p / m_e) } \\right)^3 = \\left( 207 \\cdot \\frac{1 + A m_p / m_e}{207 + A m_p / m_e} \\right)^3\n\nNow, m_p / m_e is a fundamental constant. The proton-to-electron mass ratio is approximately 1836. But we can leave it as m_p / m_e.\n\nSo:\n\n\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( 207 \\frac{1 + A (m_p / m_e) }{207 + A (m_p / m_e)} \\right)^3\n\nThis is a closed-form expression.\n\nBut the problem says \"simplified\", and we have it in terms of A and the ratio m_p/m_e.\n\nSince m_p/m_e is a fundamental constant, this is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem might expect the expression without substituting m_μ, but it is given as 207 m_e, so we can use that.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the ratio in terms of m_μ and m_e without substituting, but the problem gives m_μ = 207 m_e, so we can use 207.\n\nBut to be general, we should use m_μ. However, the problem says \"express in terms of ... m_μ\", so we can leave it as:\n\n\\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{m_\\mu + A m_p} \\right)^3\n\nBut if we substitute, we get:\n\n\\left( 207 \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{m_e + A m_p}{207 m_e + A m_p} \\right)^3 = 207^3 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1 + A (m_p / m_e)}{207 + A (m_p / m_e)} \\right)^3\n\nBut this is the same as above.\n\nNow, the problem does not specify whether to substitute m_μ or not. Since it is given as 207 m_e, we can use 207.\n\nBut in the expression, we have m_p/m_e. We can denote the constant as the proton-to-electron mass ratio, but in the box we just write the expression.\n\nSo let's decide: the ratio is:\n\n\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{207 (1 + A \\frac{m_p}{m_e})}{207 + A \\frac{m_p}{m_e}} \\right)^3\n\nBut we can also write:\n\n= \\left( \\frac{207 m_e + 207 A m_p}{207 m_e + A m_p} \\right)^3   [by multiplying numerator and denominator by m_e]\n\nBut that doesn't help.\n\nI think the cleanest is to write in terms of m_μ and m_e, and m_p.\n\nBut the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". So we can use m_p.\n\nAnd we note that Z and r0 do not appear, which is correct.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu} (m_{e} + A m_{p})}{m_{e} (m_{\\mu} + A m_{p})} \\right)^{3}}\n\nBut wait, we have m_p. Is there an alternative? Some texts use the nuclear mass in terms of A and the nucleon mass. But m_p is the proton mass, and for nuclei, the neutron mass is similar, so it's standard.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"mass number A\", and the nuclear mass is approximately A times the proton mass, so it's fine.\n\nSo we'll box that.\n\nHowever, in the box, we must not have any words, only the expression.\n\nBut we used m_p, which is a fundamental constant.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to avoid m_p, we might use the fact that the nuclear mass M = A * m_nuc, where m_nuc is the nucleon mass, but then we have to introduce m_nuc, which is the same as m_p for this purpose.\n\nBut I think it's standard.\n\nSo the ratio is:\n\n\\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\cdot \\frac{m_{e} + A m_{p}}{m_{\\mu} + A m_{p}} \\right)^{3}\n\nIn the box, we write it as a single expression.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\". This is closed-form.\n\nWe can write it as:\n\n\\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu} (m_{e} + A m_{p})}{m_{e} (m_{\\mu} + A m_{p})} \\right)^{3}\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to confirm, if the nuclear mass is very large compared to m_μ and m_e, then the ratio becomes (m_μ / m_e)^3 = 207^3, which is a large number.\n\nBut for light nuclei, it is less.\n\nSo we have the answer.\n\nBut note: in the derivation, we assumed that the wavefunction is constant over the nucleus. This is valid for both particles because the nuclear radius is very small compared to the Bohr radius for both the electron and the muon. However, the Bohr radius for the muon is smaller by a factor of (m_μ / m_e) because a ∝ 1/μ. But since R is fixed and a_μ = a_e * (m_e / m_μ), the muon's Bohr radius is smaller, so the approximation might be less accurate for the muon.

        "reasoning": "We are to find the ratio of the energy shifts for a muon and an electron due to the finite nuclear size in the 1s state.\n\n The energy shift for a hydrogen-like atom due to finite nuclear size in first-order perturbation theory is given by:\n\n   ΔE = ∫ ψ* δV ψ dV\n\n where ψ is the unperturbed wavefunction for the point nucleus, and δV is the perturbation in the potential.\n\n For a point nucleus, the potential is -Ze²/(4πε₀ r). For a finite nucleus with uniform charge density, the potential inside the nucleus is modified.\n\n The unperturbed ground state wavefunction for a hydrogen-like atom is:\n\n   ψ_{1s}(r) = (1/√π) (Z/a)^(3/2) exp(-Z r / a)\n\n where a is the Bohr radius for the particle. For an electron, a_e = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_e e²). For a muon, since m_μ = 207 m_e, the Bohr radius for the muon is a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_μ e²) = a_e / 207.\n\n The perturbation δV is the difference between the actual potential and the point nucleus potential:\n\n   δV(r) = V_actual(r) - V_point(r)\n\n For a uniform sphere of charge, the potential inside the nucleus (r ≤ R) is:\n\n   V_actual(r) = - (Ze²)/(8πε₀ R) [3 - (r²/R²)]   (for r ≤ R)\n\n and outside (r > R) it is the same as the point charge: -Ze²/(4πε₀ r). The point nucleus potential is -Ze²/(4πε₀ r) everywhere.\n\n Therefore, for r ≤ R:\n\n   δV(r) = - (Ze²)/(8πε₀ R) [3 - (r²/R²)] - [ -Ze²/(4πε₀ r) ]\n           = (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ - (1/(2R)) (3 - r²/R²) + 1/r ]\n\n For r > R, δV(r) = 0 because the potential is the same.\n\n However, note that the wavefunction is concentrated near the origin. Since R is very small (on the order of 10^{-15} m) and the Bohr radius is much larger (on the order of 10^{-11} m for electrons), the wavefunction is approximately constant over the nucleus. Therefore, we can use the approximation:\n\n   ΔE ≈ |ψ(0)|² ∫_{r=0}^{R} δV(r) dV\n\n where dV = 4πr² dr.\n\n This approximation is valid because the exponential in the wavefunction is approximately 1 for r near 0 (since R is small).\n\n First, compute |ψ(0)|²:\n\n   For the 1s state, ψ(0) = (1/√π) (Z/a)^{3/2}, so |ψ(0)|² = (1/π) (Z/a)^3.\n\n Now, the integral:\n\n   I = ∫_{0}^{R} δV(r) * 4πr² dr\n\n      = 4π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) ∫_{0}^{R} [ - (1/(2R)) (3 - r²/R²) + 1/r ] r² dr\n\n      = (Ze²)/ε₀ ∫_{0}^{R} [ - (1/(2R)) (3r² - r⁴/R²) + r ] dr\n\n Let's split the integral:\n\n   I = (Ze²)/ε₀ [ - (1/(2R)) ∫_{0}^{R} (3r² - r⁴/R²) dr + ∫_{0}^{R} r dr ]\n\n Compute each integral:\n\n   ∫_{0}^{R} 3r² dr = 3 * (r³/3)|_{0}^{R} = R³\n   ∫_{0}^{R} r⁴/R² dr = (1/R²) * (r⁵/5)|_{0}^{R} = R³/5\n   So, ∫_{0}^{R} (3r² - r⁴/R²) dr = R³ - R³/5 = (4/5) R³\n\n   ∫_{0}^{R} r dr = (1/2) R²\n\n Therefore,\n\n   I = (Ze²)/ε₀ [ - (1/(2R)) * (4/5) R³ + (1/2) R² ]\n      = (Ze²)/ε₀ [ - (2/5) R² + (1/2) R² ]\n      = (Ze²)/ε₀ * R² [ -2/5 + 1/2 ]\n      = (Ze²)/ε₀ * R² [ (-4 + 5)/10 ]\n      = (Ze²)/ε₀ * R² * (1/10)\n      = (Ze² R²) / (10 ε₀)\n\n Then,\n\n   ΔE = |ψ(0)|² * I = [ (1/π) (Z/a)^3 ] * [ (Ze² R²) / (10 ε₀) ]\n\n      = (Z^4 e² R²) / (10 π ε₀ a^3)\n\n Now, we can write this for the electron and the muon.\n\n For the electron:\n\n   ΔE_e = [ Z^4 e² R² ] / [ 10 π ε₀ a_e^3 ]\n\n For the muon:\n\n   ΔE_μ = [ Z^4 e² R² ] / [ 10 π ε₀ a_μ^3 ]\n\n The ratio:\n\n   ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [ a_e^3 ] / [ a_μ^3 ]\n\n Because all other factors are the same.\n\n Now, recall that the Bohr radius a is inversely proportional to the mass:\n\n   a = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m e²)   [for a given particle]\n\n Therefore:\n\n   a_e = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_e e²)\n\n   a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_μ e²) = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (207 m_e e²) = a_e / 207\n\n So,\n\n   a_μ = a_e / 207\n\n Then,\n\n   a_e / a_μ = 207\n\n   (a_e / a_μ)^3 = 207^3\n\n Therefore,\n\n   ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (a_e^3) / (a_μ^3) = (a_e / a_μ)^3 = 207^3\n\n However, note that the expression for ΔE also contains the factor R, which is the same for both. But we have expressed the ratio in terms of the Bohr radii.\n\n But wait: is there any dependence on Z and A? In the expression for ΔE, we have Z^4 and R^2. However, R is the same for both the electron and the muon in the same atom: R = r₀ A^{1/3}. Therefore, when we take the ratio, R cancels out. Also, Z is the same for both. So indeed the ratio is independent of Z, A, and r₀.\n\n However, note that the perturbation theory approximation requires that the nuclear size effect is small. For muons, the Bohr radius is smaller by a factor of 207, so the wavefunction is more concentrated near the nucleus. Therefore, the approximation we used (that ψ is constant over the nucleus) is better for the muon than for the electron. But the formula we derived is the standard one.\n\n Therefore, the ratio is:\n\n   ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (207)^3\n\n But let me double-check the exponent: we have a^3 in the denominator of ΔE, and a_μ = a_e / 207, so a_μ^3 = a_e^3 / (207)^3, hence ΔE_μ is 207^3 times ΔE_e.\n\n However, note that the problem asks for the ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e, so:\n\n   ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (a_e^3) / (a_μ^3) = (a_e / a_μ)^3 = 207^3.\n\n But wait: is the mass of the muon exactly 207 times the electron mass? The problem states: m_μ = 207 m_e. So yes.\n\n Therefore, the ratio is 207 cubed.\n\n But let me write it as:\n\n   (207)^3 = 207 * 207 * 207 = 8869743\n\n However, the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r₀, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". We see that the ratio is independent of Z, A, r₀, and fundamental constants (they canceled out). It only depends on the mass ratio.\n\n Alternatively, we can write it as:\n\n   ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\n because a ∝ 1/m, so (a_e / a_μ) = (m_μ / m_e), hence (a_e / a_μ)^3 = (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\n Since m_μ = 207 m_e, then m_μ / m_e = 207, so (m_μ / m_e)^3 = 207^3.\n\n Therefore, the ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\n But note: the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". We can write it as:\n\n   (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\n However, we must check if the fundamental constants are required? Actually, we have expressed it purely in terms of the masses.\n\n But note: the expression for the energy shift we derived also contains the Bohr radius which has fundamental constants. However, in the ratio, they cancel. So we don't need them.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\n However, the problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\". Since m_μ and m_e are given, and we know m_μ = 207 m_e, we can write:\n\n   (m_μ / m_e)^3 = (207)^3\n\n But the problem allows us to use m_μ and m_e. So we can write the ratio as:\n\n   \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\n However, note that the problem states m_μ = 207 m_e, so we can also write 207^3. But to be general (if the mass ratio is given), we should use the symbols.\n\n But the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". So we are allowed to use m_μ and m_e.\n\n However, observe that the ratio does not depend on Z, A, or r_0. So we don't need them.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n   \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\n But wait: is this correct? Let me reconsider the wavefunction.\n\n In the approximation, we used |ψ(0)|². For the hydrogen-like atom, we have:\n\n   |ψ(0)|² = (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\n and a ∝ 1/m. Therefore, |ψ(0)|² ∝ m^3. The integral I is the same for both particles? Actually, no: the integral I depends only on R and Z, and R is the same for both. So indeed, the entire ΔE is proportional to |ψ(0)|², and |ψ(0)|² ∝ m^3. Therefore, ΔE ∝ m^3. Hence the ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\n However, let me reexamine the integral I. We computed:\n\n   I = (Ze² R²) / (10 ε₀)\n\n This integral does not depend on the mass of the bound particle. It only depends on Z and R. Therefore, the entire mass dependence is in |ψ(0)|².\n\n So yes, the ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}\n\n But note: the problem says \"separately bound\", meaning that we are considering the same nucleus for both. So Z and R are the same.\n\n Alternatively, we can write it as 207^3. But the problem asks for an expression in terms of the given parameters. Since m_μ and m_e are given, we use them.\n\n However, the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". We see that the expression does not require Z, A, or r_0, so we can just use m_μ and m_e.\n\n But note: the Bohr radius a also depends on the reduced mass? In hydrogen-like atoms, the Bohr radius is defined with the reduced mass. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron or muon, we use the particle mass (the reduced mass is approximately the particle mass). For the electron, the reduced mass is m_e * M_nucleus / (m_e + M_nucleus) ≈ m_e. Similarly for the muon. But the muon mass is 207 m_e, which is about 207 * 9.1e-31 kg, while a typical nucleus (say, for hydrogen) is about 1.67e-27 kg. So 207 m_e is about 207 * 9.1e-31 = 1.88e-28 kg, which is still much less than the proton mass (1.67e-27 kg, so about 9 times smaller). Therefore, the reduced mass for the muon is:\n\n   μ_μ = m_μ * M_nucleus / (m_μ + M_nucleus)\n\n which is less than m_μ. However, for heavy nuclei (large A), the nucleus is much heavier, so the reduced mass is approximately m_μ. But for light nuclei, there might be a correction.\n\n The problem does not specify the nucleus, but typically for finite size effects we consider heavy nuclei. Also, in the problem, we are to use the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus, which are usually defined with the reduced mass. But the problem does not specify.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"using first-order perturbation theory with the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus\". The standard hydrogen-like wavefunctions use the reduced mass. But in many contexts, especially for non-hydrogen atoms, the wavefunction is taken with the electron mass. However, the problem is about a nucleus with atomic number Z and mass number A, so it could be any nucleus. \n\n But in the expression for the energy shift, the main dependence is on the wavefunction at the origin. The wavefunction at the origin for a hydrogen-like atom is:\n\n   |ψ(0)|² = (μ^3 Z^3) / (π ħ^6) * (e^4) ??? \n\n Actually, let's recall:\n\n   The standard hydrogen ground state wavefunction:\n\n      ψ(r) = (1/√π) (Z / a)^(3/2) exp(-Zr/a)\n\n   where a = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (μ e²)\n\n   and μ is the reduced mass.\n\n Therefore, |ψ(0)|² = (1/π) (Z / a)^3 = (1/π) [ Z μ e² / (4πε₀ ħ²) ]^3\n\n So the dependence is on μ^3.\n\n Therefore, the energy shift ΔE ∝ μ^3.\n\n Now, the reduced mass for the electron:\n\n   μ_e = m_e * M / (m_e + M) ≈ m_e   (since M >> m_e)\n\n Similarly, for the muon:\n\n   μ_μ = m_μ * M / (m_μ + M) \n\n Since m_μ = 207 m_e, and M (the nuclear mass) is about A * (proton mass) ≈ A * 1836 m_e.\n\n Therefore, for the electron, μ_e ≈ m_e.\n\n For the muon, μ_μ = m_μ * M / (m_μ + M) = 207 m_e * M / (207 m_e + M)\n\n Since M = A * 1836 m_e, then:\n\n   μ_μ = 207 m_e * (A * 1836 m_e) / (207 m_e + A * 1836 m_e)\n        = 207 * A * 1836 m_e² / (207 + A * 1836) m_e\n        = [207 * 1836 * A / (207 + 1836 A)] m_e\n\n Therefore, the ratio of the reduced masses:\n\n   μ_μ / μ_e ≈ μ_μ / m_e = 207 * 1836 * A / (207 + 1836 A)\n\n Then, the ratio of the energy shifts:\n\n   ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3 = [ 207 * 1836 * A / (207 + 1836 A) ]^3\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the nuclear mass. It gives the mass number A, so M = A * u, where u is the atomic mass unit. And u = 1822.888 m_e (approximately 1836 m_e for the proton). However, the problem does not give the proton mass in terms of m_e, so we must express without that.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". The fundamental constants would include the proton mass? But typically, we avoid introducing new constants.\n\n However, in the unperturbed wavefunction, we are using the reduced mass. Therefore, the Bohr radius a depends on the reduced mass. So the expression for |ψ(0)|² is:\n\n   |ψ(0)|² ∝ μ^3\n\n and the integral I is the same for both. Therefore, the ratio is (μ_μ / μ_e)^3.\n\n But we do not know M, the nuclear mass. However, the nuclear mass M is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon. The mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately 1836 m_e. Therefore, we can write:\n\n   μ_e = m_e * M / (m_e + M) ≈ m_e   [since M >> m_e]\n\n   μ_μ = m_μ * M / (m_μ + M) = (207 m_e) * (A * m_n) / (207 m_e + A * m_n)\n\n where m_n is the nucleon mass (approximately 1836 m_e). But the problem does not specify m_n. Moreover, the fundamental constant m_n is not listed in the parameters we can use.\n\n Alternatively, we can express M in terms of A and r_0? Not directly.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that the problem likely assumes the reduced mass is the particle mass (because for heavy nuclei, M is very large), we might neglect the reduced mass correction.\n\n In many textbooks, the finite size shift is given with the electron mass, and for muonic atoms they simply replace m_e by m_μ. So the ratio becomes (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\n Moreover, the problem states the muon mass as 207 m_e, which is a fixed ratio, so they might expect:\n\n   \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 = 207^3\n\n But to be precise, let us see the problem's intention.\n\n Since the problem says \"using ... unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus\", and in the hydrogen-like wavefunctions, the reduced mass is used, but in practice for heavy nuclei the reduced mass is very close to the particle mass. For example, for a gold nucleus (A=197), M ≈ 197 * 1836 m_e ≈ 361,000 m_e. Then:\n\n   μ_μ = 207 * 361000 / (207 + 361000) m_e ≈ 207 * 361000 / 361000 m_e = 207 m_e   (approximately)\n\n So the correction is very small. Therefore, the approximation μ_μ = m_μ is very good.\n\n Similarly, for the electron, μ_e = m_e.\n\n Therefore, we can safely use:\n\n   ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\n So the answer is:\n\n   \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}\n\n But note: the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\". We are using m_μ and m_e, and no others. This is acceptable.\n\n However, if we want to be absolutely precise and include the reduced mass effect, we would need the nuclear mass. But the problem does not give it, and it is not in terms of the allowed parameters (unless we use A and the nucleon mass, but the nucleon mass is not given). Therefore, I think the expected answer is (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\n Let me compare with known results: in muonic atoms, the finite size effect is indeed (m_μ/m_e)^3 times larger than for electronic atoms for the same nuclear charge distribution.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\n So we write:\n\n   \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}\n",

This is because the exponential is approximately 1 for r near 0 and R is small.\n\nThus, for the 1s state:\n\\[ \\langle \\psi | H' | \\psi \\rangle \\approx |\\psi(0)|^2 \\int_{r=0}^{R} H'(r) \\, dV \\]\nwhere dV = 4πr² dr.\n\nFirst, compute \\( |\\psi(0)|^2 \\):\n\\[ |\\psi(0)|^2 = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^{3/2} \\right]^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nNow, the integral of H' over the sphere (r from 0 to R):\n\\[ \\int H' \\, dV = \\int_0^R \\left[ -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{3}{2R} - \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\right] 4\\pi r^2 \\, dr \\]\n\nSimplify the expression inside:\n\\[ H' = -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{3}{2R} - \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\]\n\nMultiply by 4πr² dr and integrate from 0 to R:\n\n\\[ \\int_0^R H' \\, dV = -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot 4\\pi \\int_0^R \\left( \\frac{3}{2R} - \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) r^2 \\, dr \\]\n\\[ = -\\frac{Ze^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\int_0^R \\left( \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 - \\frac{r^4}{2R^3} - r \\right) dr \\]\n\nNow integrate term by term:\n\\[ \\int_0^R \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 \\, dr = \\frac{3}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{R^3}{3} = \\frac{R^2}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\int_0^R -\\frac{r^4}{2R^3} \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2R^3} \\cdot \\frac{R^5}{5} = -\\frac{R^2}{10} \\]\n\\[ \\int_0^R -r \\, dr = -\\frac{R^2}{2} \\]\n\nSum:\n\\[ \\frac{R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^2}{10} - \\frac{R^2}{2} = -\\frac{R^2}{10} \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ \\int_0^R H' \\, dV = -\\frac{Ze^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( -\\frac{R^2}{10} \\right) = \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nTherefore, the energy shift is:\n\\[ \\Delta E = |\\psi(0)|^2 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[ \\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4}{\\pi a^3} \\cdot \\frac{e^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nNow, recall that the Bohr radius a for a particle of mass m is:\n\\[ a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2} \\]\n\nSubstitute for a:\n\\[ a^3 = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ \\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{e^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{m^3 e^6}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2)^3} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0 \\pi} \\cdot \\frac{m^3 e^6}{64 \\pi^3 \\epsilon_0^3 \\hbar^6} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{Z^4 m^3 e^8 R^2}{640 \\pi^4 \\epsilon_0^4 \\hbar^6} \\]\n\nWe can write this as:\n\\[ \\Delta E = K m^3 R^2 \\]\nwhere K is a constant that is the same for both electron and muon (since it contains Z, e, ε0, ħ, and π which are the same for both).\n\nBut note: the radius R is the same for both because it depends on the nucleus: \\( R = r_0 A^{1/3} \\). So R is fixed for a given nucleus.\n\nTherefore, for the electron:\n\\[ \\Delta E_e = K m_e^3 R^2 \\]\nand for the muon:\n\\[ \\Delta E_\\mu = K m_\\mu^3 R^2 \\]\n\nThus, the ratio is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{K m_\\mu^3 R^2}{K m_e^3 R^2} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( m_\\mu = 207 m_e \\), we have:\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = (207)^3 \\]\n\nBut wait: is that the entire story? We must note that the approximation we used (constant wavefunction inside the nucleus) is only valid if R is much smaller than the Bohr radius. For the muon, the Bohr radius is smaller by a factor of \\( m_e / m_\\mu \\) compared to the electron. So for the muon, the Bohr radius is \\( a_\\mu = a_e \\cdot (m_e / m_\\mu) \\). Since \\( m_\\mu = 207 m_e \\), then \\( a_\\mu = a_e / 207 \\). The nuclear radius R is typically about a few femtometers, while the electron's Bohr radius is about 52900 fm (for Z=1). For a muon, the Bohr radius is about 52900/207 ≈ 256 fm. For heavy nuclei, R can be up to about 7 fm (for A≈200). So for the electron, R/a_e is very small (about 7/52900 ≈ 1.3e-4) and the approximation is excellent. For the muon, R/a_μ ≈ 7/256 ≈ 0.027, which is still small but not as extremely small. However, the problem asks for first-order perturbation using the unperturbed wavefunctions, and the standard treatment uses this approximation. Moreover, the problem does not indicate that we should do a more accurate calculation.\n\nTherefore, we proceed with the approximation.\n\nThus, the ratio is \\( (m_\\mu / m_e)^3 = 207^3 \\).\n\nBut let us check the expression for ΔE. We have:\n\\[ \\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 m^3 e^8 R^2}{640 \\pi^4 \\epsilon_0^4 \\hbar^6} \\]\n\nThe ratio is indeed \\( (m_\\mu / m_e)^3 \\) because all other factors (Z, R, and the constants) are the same for both particles in the same atom.\n\nHowever, note that the wavefunction at the origin also depends on the reduced mass, which we have included via the Bohr radius. And we have expressed a in terms of m, so the mass dependence is correctly m^3.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is \\( \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( m_\\mu = 207 m_e \\), we have:\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = 207^3 \\]\n\nWe can compute 207^3 = 207 * 207 = 42849, then 42849 * 207. Let me calculate:\n200*207 = 41400, 8*207=1656, 49*207: 50*207=10350 minus 207=10143, so total: 41400+1656=43056, then 43056+10143=53199? Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually: 207 * 200 = 41400, 207*7=1449, so 41400+1449=42849 for 207^2. Then 42849 * 207:\n  42849 * 200 = 8,569,800\n  42849 * 7 = 299,943\n  Total: 8,569,800 + 299,943 = 8,869,743\n\nBut note: we are to express in terms of the given parameters. The problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, me, mμ, and fundamental constants\". However, in the ratio, Z, A, r0, and fundamental constants cancel out. We are left with (mμ/me)^3. Since mμ is given as 207 me, we can write it as (207)^3, but strictly speaking, we are allowed to use mμ and me. However, the problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\". Since mμ = 207 me is given, we can write the ratio as (mμ/me)^3.\n\nBut note: the problem states \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, me, mμ, and fundamental constants\". So we should write it as \\( \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\).\n\nAlternatively, since mμ is given as 207 me, we can write 207^3. But to be general, we should use the symbols.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\". The ratio is independent of Z, A, r0, and fundamental constants? Actually, yes, because they cancel.\n\nBut wait: is there a dependence on Z? In our derivation, Z appears in both ΔE_μ and ΔE_e as Z^4, so it cancels in the ratio. Similarly for R (which is the same for both) and fundamental constants.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is only a function of mμ and me.\n\nSo:\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nBut note: the problem says \"using first-order perturbation theory with the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus\". We have done exactly that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\( \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\).\n\nIn the box, we write only the expression. Since we have mμ and me, and the ratio is (mμ/me)^3, we write that.\n\nBut the problem gives mμ = 207 me, so we could write 207^3. However, the problem asks to express in terms of the given parameters. So if we use mμ and me, that is acceptable. Moreover, the problem might want the expression in terms of the given mass symbols.\n\nThus, we write:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}} \\]\n\nBut note the FBO protocol: inside the box, we must write only bare expressions. We are not to include any equals signs or labels. And we must use LaTeX.\n\nHowever, the expression above is a single expression. But we are writing a fraction. Also, we are to write exactly what the ratio is.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as a power: (m_\\mu / m_e)^3.\n\nBut let me check: the problem says \"the ratio of the energy shifts\", so we are to output a single expression for that ratio.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n",

The Bohr radius depends on the reduced mass. For a particle of mass $m$, the Bohr radius is:\n\n$$a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2}$$\n\nSpecifically, for the electron, we have $a_e = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}$, and for the muon, $a_\\mu = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_\\mu e^2}$.

Therefore, we can approximate the exponential as 1 because $2Z r / a$ is very small when r is less than R.\n\nThis is because $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$ with $r_0 \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, and the Bohr radius for the electron is about $5.3 \\times 10^{-11}$ m. So for a typical atom, say A=100, R ≈ 1.2e-15 * 100^(1/3) ≈ 1.2e-15 * 4.64 ≈ 5.6e-15 m, and a_e = 5.3e-11 m. Then 2Z r / a_e is at most 2Z * (5.6e-15) / (5.3e-11) = 2Z * 1.06e-4. For Z not too large (say Z=50), this is about 0.01, so e^{-0.01} ≈ 0.99, which is very close to 1. But for muons, the Bohr radius is smaller: a_μ = a_e * (m_e / m_μ) = a_e / 207. So for the muon, 2Z r / a_μ = 2Z * 5.6e-15 * 207 / (5.3e-11) ≈ 2Z * 5.6e-15 * 207 * 1.89e10 ≈ 2Z * 2.18e-3. For Z=50, this is about 0.218, and e^{-0.218}≈0.80, which is not as close to 1. However, the problem asks for first-order perturbation theory using the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions, and we are to compute the ratio. We might need to consider the approximation or not.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify to use the approximation. However, without approximation, the integral is messy. In standard treatments, the approximation e^{-2Zr/a}≈1 is used because R is small. Moreover, the ratio might simplify.\n\nLet us proceed with the approximation: set e^{-2Zr/a} ≈ 1 for r in [0,R]. Then:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx -\\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3} \\left[ \\frac{3}{2R} \\int_0^R r^2 dr - \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\int_0^R r^4 dr - \\int_0^R r dr \\right]$$\n\nCompute the integrals:\n\n$$\\int_0^R r^2 dr = \\frac{R^3}{3}$$\n$$\\int_0^R r^4 dr = \\frac{R^5}{5}$$\n$$\\int_0^R r dr = \\frac{R^2}{2}$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx -\\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3} \\left[ \\frac{3}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{R^3}{3} - \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\cdot \\frac{R^5}{5} - \\frac{R^2}{2} \\right]$$\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{R^3}{3} = \\frac{R^2}{2}$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{2R^3} \\cdot \\frac{R^5}{5} = -\\frac{R^2}{10}$$\n$$-\\frac{R^2}{2}$$\n\nSo total:\n\n$$\\frac{R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^2}{10} - \\frac{R^2}{2} = -\\frac{R^2}{10}$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx -\\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3} \\left( -\\frac{R^2}{10} \\right) = \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3} \\cdot \\frac{R^2}{10}$$\n\nNow, we can write:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2}{10 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3}$$\n\nRecall that the Bohr radius a is defined as:\n\n$$a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2}$$\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle.\n\nSo:\n\n$$a^3 = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2} \\right)^3$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2}{10 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{m^3 e^6}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^3 \\hbar^6} = \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2 m^3 e^6}{10 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\cdot 64 \\pi^3 \\epsilon_0^3 \\hbar^6} = \\frac{Z^4 R^2 m^3 e^8}{640 \\pi^4 \\epsilon_0^4 \\hbar^6}$$\n\nWe can also express it in terms of the Bohr radius. But note the ratio we need.\n\nNow, the energy shift for the muon and the electron:\n\nFor electron: \n$$\\Delta E_e = \\frac{Z^4 R^2 m_e^3 e^8}{640 \\pi^4 \\epsilon_0^4 \\hbar^6}$$\n\nFor muon:\n$$\\Delta E_\\mu = \\frac{Z^4 R^2 m_\\mu^3 e^8}{640 \\pi^4 \\epsilon_0^4 \\hbar^6}$$\n\nNote that R is the same for both (same nucleus), and Z is the same. The only difference is in the mass.\n\nTherefore, the ratio:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{m_\\mu^3}{m_e^3}$$\n\nBut we are given that $m_\\mu = 207 m_e$, so:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = (207)^3$$\n\nHowever, we must note that in the derivation we used the approximation e^{-2Zr/a}≈1. For the muon, the Bohr radius is smaller by a factor of 207, so the argument 2Zr/a is larger by 207. Therefore, for the muon, the approximation might not be as good. But the problem says \"using first-order perturbation theory with the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions\", so we are to use the unperturbed wavefunction and the perturbation as given, and the approximation is standard.\n\nBut let us check the exact integral without approximation. We had:\n\n$$\\Delta E = -\\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3} \\left[ \\frac{3}{2R} I_2 - \\frac{1}{2R^3} I_4 - I_1 \\right]$$\n\nwhere \n$$I_n = \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} r^n dr$$\n\nWithout approximation, we can compute these integrals. The integral can be expressed in terms of the incomplete gamma function, but it is messy. However, note that the ratio might be different.\n\nBut observe: the wavefunction for the muon is more compact because a_μ is smaller. Therefore, the exponential decay is faster, but we are integrating only to R. Since R is fixed, and a_μ is smaller, the ratio 2ZR/a_μ is larger than 2ZR/a_e. Therefore, the exponential factor for the muon is smaller than for the electron (since the exponent is negative and larger in magnitude). However, in our approximation we set it to 1 for both, but actually for the electron it is closer to 1 than for the muon. So we might expect that our approximation overestimates the muon shift relative to the electron shift.\n\nBut the problem asks for the ratio using the unperturbed wavefunctions. The standard approach in many textbooks is to use the approximation that R is small so that the exponential is 1. Moreover, the ratio we got is very simple.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the integral exactly for the leading term. However, note that the exact expression for the energy shift is known to be proportional to the square of the wavefunction at the origin times the mean square radius of the nucleus. The wavefunction at the origin for 1s is:\n\n$$|\\psi(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3$$\n\nAnd the perturbation theory gives:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\int \\psi_{1s}^* \\delta V \\psi_{1s} dV \\approx |\\psi(0)|^2 \\int \\delta V dV$$\n\nBut the integral of the perturbation over space is not straightforward. However, a common expression is:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{5} |\\psi(0)|^2 (Ze^2) \\frac{R^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nBut let me recall: in the expansion of the potential, the first correction is proportional to the mean square radius.\n\nIn fact, from our earlier approximation we have:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2}{10 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3} = \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2}{10 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{m^3 e^6}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^3 \\hbar^6} = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{Z^4 R^2 m^3 e^6}{10 \\pi \\cdot 64 \\pi^3 \\epsilon_0^3 \\hbar^6} = \\frac{Z^4 R^2 m^3 e^8}{640 \\pi^4 \\epsilon_0^4 \\hbar^6}$$\n\nBut also note that $|\\psi(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z m e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3$\n\nSo:\n\n$$|\\psi(0)|^2 = \\frac{Z^3 m^3 e^6}{\\pi (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^3 \\hbar^6}$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{5} |\\psi(0)|^2 \\cdot \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{R^2}{?}$$\n\nWait, I think I recall: the standard result is:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} |\\psi(0)|^2 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nBut let me check:\n\nIf we set:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx |\\psi(0)|^2 \\int_0^R \\delta V(r) \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 dr$$\n\nBut this is an approximation assuming the wavefunction is constant. And we have:\n\n$$\\int_0^R \\delta V(r) \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 dr = 4\\pi \\int_0^R \\left[ -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{3}{2R} - \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\right] r^2 dr$$\n\n= $$-\\frac{Ze^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\int_0^R \\left( \\frac{3r^2}{2R} - \\frac{r^4}{2R^3} - r \\right) dr$$\n\n= $$-\\frac{Ze^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{3}{2R} \\frac{R^3}{3} - \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\frac{R^5}{5} - \\frac{R^2}{2} \\right] = -\\frac{Ze^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^2}{10} - \\frac{R^2}{2} \\right] = -\\frac{Ze^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( -\\frac{R^2}{10} \\right) = \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0}$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx |\\psi(0)|^2 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0} \\cdot ?$$\n\nWait, no: the volume element is already included? Actually, the integral we just did is the integral of the perturbation over space? But in the matrix element, it's the integral of the wavefunction squared times the perturbation. If we approximate the wavefunction as constant, then:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx |\\psi(0)|^2 \\int \\delta V d^3 r = |\\psi(0)|^2 \\cdot 4\\pi \\int_0^R \\delta V(r) r^2 dr = |\\psi(0)|^2 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0}$$\n\nBut note that the integral we computed was for the entire volume, so:\n\n$$\\int \\delta V d^3 r = 4\\pi \\int_0^R \\delta V(r) r^2 dr = \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0}$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx |\\psi(0)|^2 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0}$$\n\nBut we know that:\n\n$$|\\psi(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2 R^2}{10 \\epsilon_0} = \\frac{Z^4 R^2 e^2}{10 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3}$$\n\nWhich is the same as we had earlier.\n\nTherefore, the standard approximation is to take the wavefunction as constant over the nucleus. This is valid when the nuclear size is much smaller than the Bohr radius.\n\nNow, for the ratio:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{ |\\psi_{\\mu}(0)|^2 }{ |\\psi_{e}(0)|^2 }$$\n\nbecause the integral of the perturbation is the same for both (it depends only on the nucleus, not on the particle). Therefore:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^3 }{ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_e} \\right)^3 } = \\left( \\frac{a_e}{a_\\mu} \\right)^3$$\n\nNow, the Bohr radius is inversely proportional to the mass:\n\n$$a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2} \\propto \\frac{1}{m}$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\\frac{a_e}{a_\\mu} = \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} = 207$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = (207)^3$$\n\nBut note: this is the same as our previous result because we had the mass cubed.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 = 207^3$$\n\nNow, 207^3 = 207 * 207 * 207. But we can leave it as 207^3 or compute the number? The problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and since 207 is given, we can write it as a number or in terms of m_μ and m_e.\n\nBut the problem says \"in terms of Z, A, r0, me, mμ, and fundamental constants\". However, in the ratio, Z, A, r0 cancel out, and the only variables are the masses. And mμ is given as 207 me, but we can express it as (mμ/me)^3.\n\nBut note: the problem states mμ = 207 me, so we can use that.\n\nSo the ratio is (207)^3.\n\nBut let us write it as:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3$$\n\nBut the problem says \"express in terms of ...\", and we have mμ and me as given parameters, so we can leave it as (mμ/me)^3. However, the problem also says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\". Since mμ and me are given, and the ratio is a constant? Actually, mμ and me are constants, so the ratio is a constant.\n\nBut the problem says \"in terms of Z, A, r0, me, mμ\", so we can write it as:\n\n$$\\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3$$\n\nBut note that mμ = 207 me is given, so we can also write 207^3. However, the problem says \"express in terms of ...\", so we should use the symbols.\n\nBut observe: the ratio does not depend on Z, A, r0. So we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3$$\n\nBut to be precise, let's see the expression.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the numerical value: 207^3 = 207*207=42849, times 207= 8869743. But that is a big number and not necessary.\n\nThe problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and using the symbols is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the ratio is independent of the nuclear parameters because both energy shifts are proportional to R^2 and the same Z, and the mass dependence is only in the Bohr radius which is in the wavefunction at the origin.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is (mμ/me)^3.\n\nBut let me confirm with the expression we had:\n\nFrom the explicit formula:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\propto \\frac{m^3}{a^3} \\cdot R^2$$\n\nBut a ∝ 1/m, so a^3 ∝ 1/m^3, so m^3 / a^3 ∝ m^3 * m^3 = m^6? That can't be.\n\nWait: we had:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 R^2 m^3 e^8}{640 \\pi^4 \\epsilon_0^4 \\hbar^6}$$\n\nBut note that a = 4πϵ0 ħ^2 / (m e^2), so 1/a^3 = [m^3 e^6] / [(4πϵ0)^3 ħ^6]\n\nSo:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\propto m^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{a^3} \\propto m^3 \\cdot m^3 = m^6?$$\n\nBut that is not right because we also have other factors.\n\nActually, from:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2}{10 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3}$$\n\nand a ∝ 1/m, so a^3 ∝ 1/m^3, so:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\propto \\frac{1}{a^3} \\propto m^3$$\n\nSo indeed, ΔE ∝ m^3.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is (mμ/me)^3.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3$$\n\nBut the problem gives mμ = 207 me, so we can write (207)^3. However, the problem says \"in terms of ...\", so we should use the symbols. But note that the ratio is independent of Z, A, r0, so we don't need them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}$$\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r0, me, mμ, and fundamental constants\". Since the expression does not depend on Z, A, r0, we just write it in terms of me and mμ.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we can write it as (mμ/me)^3.\n\nBut note: the problem might expect the numerical value? But it says \"closed-form expression\", and using the symbols is closed-form.\n\nAlternatively, we can write 207^3, but 207 is not a fundamental constant. The problem says \"in terms of ...\", and 207 is not among them. The mass mμ is given as 207 me, but we are allowed to use mμ and me.\n\nSo I think \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 is the correct expression.\n\nBut let me see the answer format: we are to output only the boxed expression.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}$$\n\nHowever, note that the problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and this is closed-form.\n\nBut wait: is this exact? We used the approximation that the wavefunction is constant over the nucleus. For the muon, the wavefunction varies more over the nucleus, so the approximation is less accurate. However, the problem instructs to use the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions and first-order perturbation theory. The standard approach is to use the wavefunction evaluated at the origin, so the ratio should be as above.\n\nMoreover, if we had not approximated, the ratio would be more complicated and depend on Z and R. But the problem asks for a ratio that is independent of Z and A, so they must cancel, which they do in the approximation.\n\nTherefore, we proceed.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}$$\n",

        "reasoning": "First, the problem is about finding the ratio of energy shifts for an electron and a muon due to the finite size of the nucleus. The nucleus has atomic number Z and mass number A, with radius R = r₀ A^{1/3}. The energy shifts are for the 1s state, and we're using first-order perturbation theory with hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus.\n\nThe energy shift due to finite nuclear size for a hydrogen-like atom is given by the first-order perturbation theory. The perturbation Hamiltonian ΔH is the difference between the actual potential and the point nucleus potential.\n\nFor a point nucleus, the potential is V_point(r) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/r.\n\nFor a uniform spherical charge distribution of radius R, the potential inside the sphere is different. For r ≤ R, V_finite(r) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/(2R) * (3 - (r²/R²)), and for r > R, it's the same as point nucleus, but since the wavefunction is concentrated near the nucleus, we care about the inside part for the shift.\n\nThe perturbation ΔV = V_finite - V_point.\n\nSpecifically, for r ≤ R, ΔV(r) = V_finite(r) - V_point(r) = [ - (Ze²)/(8πε₀ R) (3 - r²/R²) ] - [ - (Ze²)/(4πε₀ r) ] = (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -1/(2R) (3 - r²/R²) + 1/r ]\n\nLet me compute that carefully.\n\nV_point(r) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/r\n\nV_finite(r) for r ≤ R: - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/(2R) * (3 - r²/R²)\n\nSo ΔV(r) = V_finite - V_point = - (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * [1/(2R) (3 - r²/R²) - 1/r]\n\n= (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -1/(2R) (3 - r²/R²) + 1/r ]\n\n= (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ]\n\nNow, the first-order energy shift is ΔE = <ψ| ΔV |ψ>, where ψ is the unperturbed wavefunction for the point nucleus.\n\nFor the 1s state, the hydrogen-like wavefunction is ψ(r) = (1/√π) * (Z/a)^(3/2) * e^{-Zr/a}, where a is the Bohr radius for the particle.\n\nThe Bohr radius depends on the reduced mass. For a particle of mass m bound to a nucleus of mass M_nuc, the reduced mass μ = m M_nuc / (m + M_nuc). But since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron or muon, M_nuc >> m, so μ ≈ m.\n\nThe mass number A is large, so for both electron and muon, the reduced mass is approximately m_e or m_μ, respectively.\n\nSo for electron, μ_e ≈ m_e, Bohr radius a_e = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_e e²)\n\nSimilarly for muon, μ_μ ≈ m_μ, Bohr radius a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_μ e²)\n\nThe wavefunction for 1s state: ψ(r) = (1/√π) (Z/a)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a}\n\nWhere a is the Bohr radius for that particle.\n\nNow, the energy shift ΔE = ∫ ψ* ΔV ψ dV\n\nSince it's spherically symmetric, we can integrate over angles.\n\ndV = 4π r² dr\n\nSo ΔE = ∫_0^∞ ψ^2(r) ΔV(r) 4π r² dr\n\nBut ΔV(r) is zero for r > R, because outside, V_finite = V_point, so ΔV=0 for r > R.\n\nFor r > R, V_finite = V_point, so ΔV=0.\n\nTherefore, the integral is only from 0 to R.\n\nSo ΔE = ∫_0^R [ψ(r)]^2 ΔV(r) 4π r² dr\n\nNow ψ(r) = (1/√π) (Z/a)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a}\n\nSo [ψ(r)]^2 = [1/π] (Z/a)^3 e^{-2Z r / a}\n\nBecause (1/√π)^2 = 1/π.\n\nNow, ΔV(r) = (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ]\n\nAs I had earlier.\n\nSo let's write ΔE = ∫_0^R [1/π (Z/a)^3 e^{-2Z r / a}] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] * 4π r² dr\n\nSimplify: the π in denominator and 4π in numerator, so 4π / π = 4.\n\nΔE = [1/π (Z/a)^3] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] r² dr\n\nSimplify constants: 1/π * 4π = 4, and 4 in numerator, so 4/4 =1? Let's see:\n\n[1/π] * [1/(4π ε₀)] * 4π = [1/π] * 4π * [1/(4π ε₀)] = 4 * [1/(4π ε₀)] = 1/(π ε₀)? No.\n\nConstants: (Ze²)/(4πε₀) is there, and then multiplied by 4π from dV, and the 1/π from ψ^2.\n\nSo overall constant: [1/π] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π = [1/π] * 4π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 1?  [1/π] * 4π = 4, so 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀) * 1/4? Let's compute:\n\n[1/π] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π = [1/π] * 4π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = 4 * (1/π) * π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) better:\n\n(1/π) * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π = (1/π) * 4π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (4/4) * (Ze²)/(πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀)\n\n4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (4/4) * (Ze²)/(πε₀) = 1 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀)\n\nBut we also have the (Z/a)^3 from ψ^2.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nSo constants include (Z/a)^3 as well.\n\nSo let's write:\n\nΔE = [1/π (Z/a)^3] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] r² dr\n\nNow, [1/π] * 4π = 4, so:\n\n= (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4 ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] r² dr\n\nSimplify: (Z/a)^3 * 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) * (1/1) since 4/4=1\n\n4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀), yes.\n\nSo ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} r² [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] dr\n\nNow, let's distribute r²:\n\n= (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) r² + (r⁴)/(2R³) + r ] dr\n\nBecause r² * [ -3/(2R) ] = -3/(2R) r²\n\nr² * (r²)/(2R³) = r⁴/(2R³)\n\nr² * (1/r) = r\n\nSo the integral is ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ r - (3/(2R)) r² + (1/(2R³)) r⁴ ] dr\n\nFrom above: [ -3/(2R) r² + (r⁴)/(2R³) + r ]\n\nSo ∫ e^{-k r} [ c1 r + c2 r² + c3 r⁴ ] dr with k = 2Z/a\n\nBut since R is small, and for 1s state, the wavefunction is slowly varying if R << a, which it usually is, but here we need to integrate.\n\nIn perturbation theory for finite size, we often assume that R is small, so e^{-2Z r / a} ≈ 1 for r near 0, since the exponential is approximately 1 when r is small.\n\nFor the 1s state, the probability density is constant near r=0, so for small R, we can approximate the integral.\n\nIn fact, for small R, the dominant contribution comes from the 1/r term in ΔV, but let's see.\n\nTypically, for finite size shift, the energy shift is proportional to the probability density at r=0 times the integral of ΔV, but ΔV has a 1/r behavior, so we need to be careful.\n\nLet's recall the standard result.\n\nI remember that for hydrogen-like atoms, the finite size energy shift for s-states is ΔE = (2π/5) |ψ(0)|^2 (Ze² R²) / (4πε₀ something), but let's derive it.\n\nIn our expression, we have terms with r, r², r⁴.\n\nSince R is small, and e^{-2Z r / a} ≈ 1 for r < R, because 2Z r / a << 1 if R << a/Z, which is true for light nuclei, but for large Z, it might not hold, but we'll assume the approximation.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, but in perturbation theory, we integrate as is.\n\nBut for the ratio, it might simplify.\n\nLet's define k = 2Z / a\n\nSo the integral I = ∫_0^R e^{-k r} [ r - (3/(2R)) r² + (1/(2R³)) r⁴ ] dr\n\nNow, for small kR, we can expand e^{-k r} ≈ 1 - k r + (k r)^2 / 2 - ... but since we have up to r^4, we need to keep terms.\n\nBut in standard treatment, for the 1s state, |ψ(0)|^2 = [1/π] (Z/a)^3\n\nAnd the energy shift is often given as ΔE = (2/5) (Ze² R²) / (4πε₀) * |ψ(0)|^2 * something.\n\nLet's compute the integral without approximation.\n\nSet u = k r, so r = u / k, dr = du / k\n\nThen I = ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ (u/k) - (3/(2R)) (u/k)^2 + (1/(2R³)) (u/k)^4 ] (du / k)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/k) ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ u/k - (3/(2R)) (u²/k²) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4/k^4) ] du / k? Let's see:\n\nr = u/k, dr = du/k\n\nSo I = ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ (u/k) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^2) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^4) ] (du / k)\n\n= ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ (u / k^2) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^3) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^5) ] du\n\nNow k = 2Z/a, so k is large if Z is large or a is small.\n\nBut R is small, kR = (2Z/a) R\n\nNow R = r_0 A^{1/3}, a is Bohr radius, which for electron is about 5e-11 m, r_0 is about 1.2e-15 m, A^{1/3} for A=1 is 1, so R ~ 1e-15, a~5e-11, so R/a ~ 2e-5, so kR = 2Z R/a ~ 2Z * 2e-5 = 4e-5 Z, for Z=1, very small, for Z=100, 4e-3, still small. So kR << 1 for all practical purposes, so we can approximate the integral by the value at upper limit or expand.\n\nSince kR << 1, e^{-u} ≈ 1 for u from 0 to kR, so I ≈ ∫_0^{kR} [ (u / k^2) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^3) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^5) ] du\n\nBut the limits are from 0 to kR, and since kR small, we can integrate each term.\n\nBut let's keep it as is.\n\nSince e^{-u} ≈ 1, and the integral is from 0 to kR, so I ≈ ∫_0^{kR} [ r term etc.] but with u.\n\nFrom above:\n\nI ≈ ∫_0^{kR} [ (u / k^2) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^3) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^5) ] du\n\nIntegrate:\n\n∫_0^{kR} u du = (1/2) u^2 |}_0^{kR} = (1/2) (kR)^2\n\n∫_0^{kR} u^2 du = (1/3) u^3 |}_0^{kR} = (1/3) (kR)^3\n\n∫_0^{kR} u^4 du = (1/5) u^5 |}_0^{kR} = (1/5) (kR)^5\n\nSo I ≈ [ (1/k^2) * (1/2) (kR)^2 ] - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 * (1/3) (kR)^3 ] + [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 * (1/5) (kR)^5 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: (1/k^2) * (1/2) k^2 R^2 = (1/2) R^2\n\nSecond term: - (3/(2R)) * (1/k^3) * (1/3) k^3 R^3 = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 * (k^3 / k^3) = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) R^2? Let's compute:\n\n(3/(2R)) / k^3 * (1/3) (kR)^3 = (3/(2R)) * (1/k^3) * (1/3) k^3 R^3 = (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (1/2) R^2? (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (3/3) * (1/2) R^{3-1} = 1 * (1/2) R^2 = (1/2) R^2\n\nBut there is a minus sign, so - [ (1/2) R^2 ] = - (1/2) R^2\n\nThird term: (1/(2R³)) / k^5 * (1/5) (kR)^5 = (1/(2R³)) * (1/k^5) * (1/5) k^5 R^5 = (1/(2R³)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2) (1/5) R^{5-3} = (1/10) R^2\n\n(1/(2R³)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2)(1/5) R^{2} = (1/10) R^2\n\nSo I ≈ [ (1/2) R^2 ] + [ - (1/2) R^2 ] + [ (1/10) R^2 ] = (1/2 - 1/2 + 1/10) R^2 = (0 + 1/10) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nI = ∫ ... du, and we have I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nBut let's check the terms:\n\nFirst term contributed + (1/2) R^2\n\nSecond term contributed - (1/2) R^2\n\nThird term contributed + (1/10) R^2\n\nSo total (1/2 - 1/2 + 1/10) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nNow, is this correct? I think I missed something.\n\nIn the integral, for the r term, which is the first one, it gave + (1/2) R^2, but let's see the coefficient.\n\nEarlier I had:\n\nI ≈ [ (u/k^2) term: ∫ (u/k^2) du from 0 to kR = (1/k^2) * (1/2) u^2 |_0^{kR} = (1/k^2) * (1/2) (kR)^2 = (1/2) R^2\n\nThen - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] ∫ u^2 du = - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] * (1/3) u^3 |_0^{kR} = - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] * (1/3) (kR)^3 = - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] * (1/3) k^3 R^3 = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) R^2 * R? (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (3/3) (1/2) R^{3-1} = (1/2) R^2, yes - (1/2) R^2\n\nThen + [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] ∫ u^4 du = [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] * (1/5) u^5 |_0^{kR} = [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] * (1/5) (kR)^5 = [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] * (1/5) k^5 R^5 = (1/(2R³)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2)(1/5) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nSo I ≈ 0 + 0 + (1/10) R^2? 1/2 - 1/2 + 1/10 = 1/10 R^2\n\nBut I recall that in the standard formula, there is a term.\n\nPerhaps the r term is important, but here it canceled with the r^2 term.\n\nIn ΔV, the 1/r term gives a singularity, but in the integral with r^2 dr, it becomes r dr, which is integrable.\n\nBut in this approximation, the leading term is from the r^4 part? No, we have (1/10) R^2.\n\nLet me compute the integral more carefully.\n\nFrom the expression, I = ∫_0^R e^{-k r} [ r - (3/(2R)) r^2 + (1/(2R^3)) r^4 ] dr\n\nFor small kR, e^{-k r} ≈ 1, so I ≈ ∫_0^R [ r - (3/(2R)) r^2 + (1/(2R^3)) r^4 ] dr\n\nCompute this integral:\n\n∫ r dr = (1/2) r^2 |}_0^R = (1/2) R^2\n\n∫ - (3/(2R)) r^2 dr = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) r^3 |}_0^R = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) R^2 * R? - (1/2) R^2? (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (1/2) R^2, so - (1/2) R^2\n\n∫ (1/(2R^3)) r^4 dr = (1/(2R^3)) * (1/5) r^5 |}_0^R = (1/(2R^3)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2)(1/5) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nSo I ≈ (1/2 R^2) - (1/2 R^2) + (1/10 R^2) = (1/10) R^2\n\nBut this can't be right because the r and r^2 terms canceled, leaving only the r^4 term which is small, but I think I have a mistake.\n\nIn ΔV, the constant term is there.\n\nLet's go back to ΔV.\n\nΔV(r) = (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r^2/(2R^3) + 1/r ]\n\nThen in the integral for ΔE, we have ψ^2 ΔV, and ψ^2 is proportional to e^{-2Z r / a}, but at r=0, it's constant.\n\nWhen we multiply by r^2 dr, for the 1/r term in ΔV, it becomes r dr, which is fine.\n\nBut in the expression above, for the integral ∫ ψ^2 ΔV r^2 dr, the term with 1/r in ΔV gives ∫ ψ^2 (1/r) r^2 dr = ∫ ψ^2 r dr, which for small r, ψ^2 is constant, so it's like ∫ r dr from 0 to R, which is (1/2) R^2.\n\nSimilarly, the constant term in ΔV, -3/(2R), gives ∫ ψ^2 (-3/(2R)) r^2 dr, which for small R, ψ^2 constant, so -3/(2R) * constant * ∫ r^2 dr = -3/(2R) * const * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) const R^2\n\nAnd the r^2 term in ΔV gives ∫ ψ^2 (r^2/(2R^3)) r^2 dr = ∫ ψ^2 (1/(2R^3)) r^4 dr ≈ const * (1/(2R^3)) * (1/5) R^5 = const * (1/10) R^2\n\nSo all terms are proportional to R^2, and with the constants, we got (1/10) R^2 for the integral part.\n\nBut in my calculation, the first two terms canceled, leaving only the third.\n\nBut I think the standard result for finite size shift is ΔE = (2/5) * (Ze^2 R^2) / (4πε₀) * |ψ(0)|^2 for s-states.\n\nLet me recall.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 for 1s is (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\nStandard formula: for a uniform sphere, the energy shift for s-state is ΔE = (2/5) π (Ze^2) R^2 |ψ(0)|^2 / (4πε₀) or something.\n\nI think I have a factor missing.\n\nLet's look back at my expression for ΔE.\n\nFrom earlier, ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * I\n\nAnd I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Z/a)^3 is related to |ψ(0)|^2.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 = [1/π] (Z/a)^3, so (Z/a)^3 = π |ψ(0)|^2\n\nSo ΔE = π |ψ(0)|^2 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * (1/10) R^2 = |ψ(0)|^2 * (Ze^2)/(ε₀) * (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(ε₀) , but usually we have 4πε₀.\n\nI think I missed the 4π.\n\nLet's check the constant.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * I\n\nWith I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) , and ε₀ is permittivity, but in cgs or SI, I need to be careful.\n\nIn atomic physics, often e^2 is used for e^2/(4πε₀), but in the problem, it's written with 4πε₀, so I should keep it.\n\nIn the potential, V = - (1/(4πε₀)) Ze^2 / r, so e here is the charge, and 4πε₀ is there.\n\nSo in my expression, I have (Ze^2)/(4πε₀) in ΔV, but in the constant for ΔE, I had:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * I\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) , but (Ze^2)/(4πε₀) is the common combination.\n\nLet's see:\n\nI had ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(πε₀) * I\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(πε₀) = 4 * (Ze^2)/(4πε₀)\n\nBecause 1/ε₀ = 4π / (4π ε₀) * 4π? 1/ε₀ = 4π k, with k=1/(4πε₀), but let's write:\n\n(Ze^2)/(πε₀) = (Ze^2)/π * 1/ε₀ = (Ze^2)/π * 4π / (4π ε₀) * 4π? 1/ε₀ = 4π * (1/(4πε₀)) = 4π k, where k=1/(4πε₀)\n\nSo (Ze^2)/(πε₀) = (Ze^2)/π * 4π k = 4 Ze^2 k\n\nWith k=1/(4πε₀)\n\nSimilarly, (Ze^2)/(4πε₀) = k Ze^2\n\nSo (Ze^2)/(πε₀) = 4 k Ze^2\n\nNow, I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nSo ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * 4 k Ze^2 * (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Z/a)^3 = π |ψ(0)|^2, since |ψ(0)|^2 = (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\nSo ΔE = π |ψ(0)|^2 * 4 k Ze^2 * (1/10) R^2 = 4π |ψ(0)|^2 k Ze^2 (1/10) R^2\n\nNow k Ze^2 is (Ze^2)/(4πε₀)\n\nBut the standard formula is often ΔE = (2/5) (Ze^2 R^2) / (4πε₀) |ψ(0)|^2 for uniform sphere.\n\n(2/5) k Ze^2 R^2 |ψ(0)|^2\n\nBut here I have 4π (1/10) = 4π/10 = 2π/5\n\n4π/10 = 2π/5, and 2π/5 vs 2/5, I have an extra π.\n\n2π/5 vs 2/5, so I missed a factor.\n\nI think I know where.\n\nIn the integral, when I approximated, I got I = (1/10) R^2, but let's compute the integral without approximation for small R.\n\nFrom the expression, the energy shift can be written as.\n\nAnother way: the perturbation ΔV, and for s-state, the shift is proportional to the average of ΔV.\n\nBut let's calculate the integral I defined.\n\nI = ∫_0^R e^{-k r} [ r - (3/(2R)) r^2 + (1/(2R^3)) r^4 ] dr\n\nWith k = 2Z/a\n\nFor small kR, e^{-k r} = 1 - k r + (k r)^2 / 2 - (k r)^3 / 6 + ...\n\nBut since we have terms up to r^4, we need to expand.\n\nPerhaps the constant term in the brackets is missing.\n\nLet's list the terms in the brackets: r, - (3/(2R)) r^2, + (1/(2R^3)) r^4\n\nWhen we integrate with e^{-k r}, the leading term for small R is from the r term, because it's the lowest power.\n\nFor example, the r term: ∫_0^R e^{-k r} r dr\n\nFor small kR, ≈ ∫_0^R r dr = (1/2) R^2\n\nBut if kR is not zero, ∫_0^R e^{-k r} r dr = [ - (r/k) e^{-k r} - (1/k^2) e^{-k r} ] from 0 to R or something.\n\nLet's compute the antiderivative.\n\n∫ e^{-k r} r dr = - (r/k) e^{-k r} - ∫ - (1/k) e^{-k r} dr = - (r/k) e^{-k r} + (1/k) ∫ e^{-k r} dr = - (r/k) e^{-k r} - (1/k^2) e^{-k r} + c\n\nSo at r=R, - (R/k) e^{-k R} - (1/k^2) e^{-k R}\n\nAt r=0, - (0) - (1/k^2) (1) = -1/k^2\n\nSo ∫_0^R e^{-k r} r dr = [ - (R/k) e^{-k R} - (1/k^2) e^{-k R} ] - [ -1/k^2 ] = - (R/k) e^{-k R} - (1/k^2) e^{-k R} + 1/k^2\n\nFor small kR, e^{-k R} ≈ 1 - kR + (kR)^2/2 - ..., so - (R/k) (1 - kR + (kR)^2/2) - (1/k^2) (1 - kR + (kR)^2/2) + 1/k^2 = - (R/k) + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 / k?

from e^{-kR} ≈ 1 - kR + (k^2 R^2)/2 - ...\n\nSo - (R/k) * (1 - kR + (k^2 R^2)/2 - ...) = - (R/k) + (R/k)(kR) - (R/k)(k^2 R^2)/2 + ... = - R/k + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 * k? (R/k) * (k^2 R^2)/2 = R * k R^2 /2 = (k R^3)/2\n\nLet's write:\n\n- (R/k) * 1 = - R/k\n\n- (R/k) * (- kR) = - (R/k) (-kR) = + (R/k)(kR) = + R^2\n\n- (R/k) * ( (k^2 R^2)/2 ) = - (R/k) (k^2 R^2)/2 = - (k R^3)/2\n\nSimilarly, - (1/k^2) e^{-kR} = - (1/k^2) (1 - kR + (k^2 R^2)/2 - ...) = -1/k^2 + (1/k^2)(kR) - (1/k^2)(k^2 R^2)/2 + ... = -1/k^2 + R/k - (R^2)/2\n\nThen +1/k^2 from the lower limit.\n\nSo total for ∫ r e^{-kr} dr from 0 to R:\n\nFrom above: - R/k + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 + ... + [ -1/k^2 + R/k - R^2/2 + ... ] + 1/k^2\n\nSimplify: - R/k + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 -1/k^2 + R/k - R^2/2 + 1/k^2 + higher order\n\nNow - R/k + R/k = 0\n\n-1/k^2 + 1/k2 = 0\n\nR^2 - R^2/2 = (1/2) R^2\n\n- (k R^3)/2 + higher order\n\nSo for small kR, ≈ (1/2) R^2 - (k R^3)/2 + ...\n\nSimilarly, for other terms.\n\nBut in our case, for the r term in the brackets, it's part of I.\n\nBut in I, we have also the other terms.\n\nFor the finite size shift, the main contribution comes from the 1/r part of ΔV, which gives the r term in the brackets.\n\nIn the standard derivation, for the uniform sphere, the energy shift is ΔE = (2/5) (Ze^2 R^2) / (4πε₀) |ψ(0)|^2\n\nLet me assume that for now.\n\nFor example, in hydrogen, for electron, it's small.\n\nSo for a particle, ΔE proportional to |ψ(0)|^2 R^2\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 for 1s state is proportional to (Z/a)^3, and a is the Bohr radius, which depends on the reduced mass.\n\nBohr radius a = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (μ e^2), where μ is the reduced mass.\n\nFor electron, μ ≈ m_e, so a_e = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_e e^2)\n\nFor muon, μ ≈ m_μ, so a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_μ e^2)\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 = (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\nSo for a given nucleus, Z and R are the same for both electron and muon.\n\nR is the same, since it's the nucleus radius.\n\nThe energy shift ΔE_e for electron proportional to |ψ(0)|_e^2 R^2\n\nSimilarly for muon, ΔE_μ proportional to |ψ(0)|_μ^2 R^2\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 proportional to (Z/a)^3, and a proportional to 1/μ, since a = constant / μ\n\nFrom a = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (μ e^2), so a ∝ 1/μ\n\nTherefore |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ (Z / a)^3 ∝ (Z * μ)^3, since a ∝ 1/μ, so 1/a ∝ μ\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ μ^3\n\nTherefore ΔE ∝ |ψ(0)|^2 R^2 ∝ μ^3 R^2\n\nBut R is the same for both, so ΔE ∝ μ^3\n\nThus for muon and electron, ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nBut μ ≈ mass of the particle, since nucleus is heavy, so μ_μ = m_μ, μ_e = m_e\n\nm_μ = 207 m_e, so (m_μ / m_e)^3 = (207)^3\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nIn the ratio, R and Z are the same, so yes.\n\nBut in the energy shift, is it proportional to μ^3?\n\nFrom the standard formula, ΔE = constant * |ψ(0)|^2 R^2, and |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ (μ)^3, so ΔE ∝ μ^3.\n\nFor muon, since m_μ >> m_e, a_μ is smaller, so |ψ(0)|^2 is larger, so the shift is larger.\n\nThe ratio should be (m_μ / m_e)^3 = 207^3.\n\nBut is this for the point nucleus wavefunction? Yes, perturbation theory.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"using first-order perturbation theory with the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus\", so yes.\n\nNow, but in my earlier calculation, I had a discrepancy with the factor.\n\nPerhaps for the ratio, the constant cancels.\n\nLet's confirm with the formula.\n\nThe ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [ |ψ(0)|_μ^2 ] / [ |ψ(0)|_e^2 ] since R and other constants same.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 for 1s is (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\na = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (μ e^2)\n\nSo for electron, a_e = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_e e^2)\n\nFor muon, a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_μ e^2)\n\nSo |ψ(0)|_e^2 = (1/π) (Z / a_e)^3\n\n|ψ(0)|_μ^2 = (1/π) (Z / a_μ)^3\n\nSo ratio |ψ(0)|_μ^2 / |ψ(0)|_e^2 = [ (Z / a_μ)^3 ] / [ (Z / a_e)^3 ] = (a_e / a_μ)^3\n\nBut a_e / a_μ = [ (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_e e^2) ] / [ (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_μ e^2) ] = m_μ / m_e\n\nSince m_μ = 207 m_e\n\nSo a_e / a_μ = m_μ / m_e = 207\n\nTherefore |ψ(0)|_μ^2 / |ψ(0)|_e^2 = (207)^3\n\nThus ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (207)^3\n\nBut ΔE is proportional to |ψ(0)|^2, so ratio is (207)^3.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of energy shifts, and to express in terms of the parameters, but since it's simplified, and 207 is given.\n\nm_μ = 207 m_e, so it's fine.\n\nBut is there any dependence on Z or A? In this ratio, Z and A cancel out, because R is the same, and in |ψ(0)|^2, Z is the same, but in the ratio, Z cancels, and R cancels.\n\nIn ΔE ∝ |ψ(0)|^2 R^2, and |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ Z^3, R ∝ A^{1/3}, but in the ratio, for the same atom, Z and A are fixed, so for different particles, Z and A are same, so only the mass ratio matters.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the ratio should be (m_μ / m_e)^3 = 207^3.\n\nBut let's confirm the energy shift formula.\n\nI think I have a mistake because in my initial integral, I got a factor, but for the ratio, it cancels.\n\nPerhaps the standard factor is included.\n\nAnother thing: in the perturbation, for the finite size, the shift is indeed proportional to R^2 |ψ(0)|^2 for s-states.\n\nFor example, in quantum mechanics books.\n\nSo for the ratio, ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [ |ψ(0)|_μ^2 ] / [ |ψ(0)|_e^2 ] = (a_e / a_μ)^3 = (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nSince a ∝ 1/μ.\n\nSo (207)^3.\n\nBut the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\", but in this case, the ratio is just (m_μ / m_e)^3, which is 207^3, but since m_μ and m_e are given, we can write it as (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nFundamental constants are not needed since it's a ratio.\n\nBut let's see the answer should be a number, but with the masses.\n\nm_μ = 207 m_e, so it's fine.\n\nBut in the box, we need to write the expression.\n\nThe ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nIn the wavefunction, the Bohr radius depends on the reduced mass.\n\nFor electron, reduced mass μ_e = m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ≈ m_e since M_nuc >> m_e.\n\nSimilarly for muon, m_μ = 207 m_e, but M_nuc is still much larger, since nucleus mass is at least proton mass, which is about 1836 m_e, and m_μ = 207 m_e, so M_nuc min is about 1836 m_e for hydrogen, but for larger A, larger.\n\nFor hydrogen, Z=1, A=1, M_nuc = m_p ≈ 1836 m_e, m_μ = 207 m_e, so M_nuc / m_μ ≈ 1836 / 207 ≈ 8.87, so about 9 times, not much larger, but still, reduced mass μ_μ = m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) = m_μ / (1 + m_μ/M_nuc) ≈ m_μ (1 - m_μ/M_nuc)\n\nSimilarly for electron, μ_e ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M_nuc)\n\nBut in the ratio, it might have a small correction.\n\nHowever, in the problem, it says \"using the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus\", and typically, for hydrogen-like, we use the reduced mass.\n\nBut in the wavefunction, a = 4πε₀ ħ^2 / (μ e^2), with μ reduced mass.\n\nBut for the ratio, if we include reduced mass.\n\nLet μ_e be reduced mass for electron system: μ_e = m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc)\n\nμ_μ for muon: μ_μ = m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nThen a_e = 4πε₀ ħ^2 / (μ_e e^2)\n\na_μ = 4πε₀ ħ^2 / (μ_μ e^2)\n\nThen |ψ(0)|^2 proportional to (μ)^3, since a ∝ 1/μ, so (1/a) ∝ μ.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 ∝ μ^3\n\nThus ΔE ∝ μ^3 R^2\n\nR same, so ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nNow μ_μ / μ_e = [ m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ] = [ m_μ / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / m_e ]\n\n= (m_μ / m_e) * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]\n\nM_nuc is the nuclear mass, which is proportional to A, since mass number.\n\nM_nuc ≈ A m_p, with m_p proton mass.\n\nBut in terms of the given, A is given.\n\nIn the ratio, we have (m_μ / m_e) * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]\n\nSince M_nuc >> m_e, m_e + M_nuc ≈ M_nuc\n\nm_μ + M_nuc ≈ M_nuc if M_nuc >> m_μ, but for light nuclei, not necessarily.\n\nFor example, for hydrogen, M_nuc = m_p ≈ 1836 m_e, m_μ = 207 m_e, so m_μ / M_nuc ≈ 207/1836 ≈ 0.112, so not negligible.\n\nSimilarly, m_e / M_nuc negligible.\n\nSo (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ≈ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nAnd M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) = 1 / (m_μ/M_nuc + 1)\n\nSimilarly, μ_μ / μ_e ≈ (m_μ / m_e) * [ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ M_nuc / M_nuc ] since μ_e ≈ m_e, but with reduced mass.\n\nFrom above:\n\nμ_μ / μ_e = (m_μ / m_e) * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] ≈ (m_μ / m_e) * [ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] since m_e negligible\n\nAnd M_nuc = A m_N, where m_N is nucleon mass, but we can write in terms of A.\n\nThe problem gives mass number A, so M_nuc ∝ A.\n\nSpecifically, M_nuc = u A, where u is atomic mass unit, but u is proportional to m_p, etc.\n\nBut in the expression, we have M_nuc.\n\nBut the problem asks to express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants.\n\nFundamental constants include ħ, c, etc., but here we have M_nuc.\n\nM_nuc is not given directly, but we can use A.\n\nSince M_nuc ∝ A, and the nucleon mass is constant, but in the ratio, we need the actual mass.\n\nPerhaps we can write M_nuc = A m_p, but m_p is not given, it's a fundamental constant.\n\nm_p is the proton mass.\n\nBut the problem says \"fundamental constants\", so we can use m_p or something.\n\nTo avoid, perhaps in the approximation, since for most atoms, M_nuc >> m_μ, so μ_μ ≈ m_μ, μ_e ≈ m_e, so ratio (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nBut for precision, let's include.\n\nThe ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nWith μ_μ = m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nμ_e = m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc)\n\nSo (μ_μ / μ_e) = [ m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ] = (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nNow M_nuc is the nuclear mass, which is approximately A times the proton mass, but since A is given, and proton mass is fundamental, but we can write.\n\nIn the context, r_0 is given, which is used for R, but R cancels in ratio.\n\nSimilarly, Z cancels.\n\nSo the ratio is (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nM_nuc = mass of nucleus.\n\nThe mass number A is given, so M_nuc = A u, where u is the atomic mass unit, but u = m_p approximately, since proton mass.\n\nTo be precise, we can use A and the proton mass.\n\nBut the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\", so fundamental constants include the proton mass or atomic mass unit.\n\nSince M_nuc appears, we need to include it.\n\nIn the expression, (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) can be written as 1 / [ (m_μ + M_nuc) / (m_e + M_nuc) ] but not helpful.\n\nLet's write the ratio as:\n\nΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3 = [ (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]^3\n\nM_nuc = A m_p, where m_p is the proton mass.\n\nSo = [ (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + A m_p) / (m_μ + A m_p) ]^3\n\nm_p is a fundamental constant.\n\nSince m_μ = 207 m_e, we can write in terms of m_e and m_μ.\n\nBut A and m_p are there.\n\nPerhaps for the ratio, since M_nuc >> m_e, we approximate (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ≈ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) = 1 / (m_μ/M_nuc + 1)\n\nAnd m_μ/M_nuc = m_μ/(A m_p)\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nI think in most contexts, for muonic atoms, the finite size shift is larger because of the reduced Bohr radius, and the reduced mass effect is secondary.\n\nBut to be accurate, let's see what the problem expects.\n\nThe problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and \"in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\".\n\nFundamental constants include ħ, c, e, m_p, etc.\n\nBut in the ratio, many cancel.\n\nPerhaps we can assume M_nuc >> m_μ, so μ_μ ≈ m_μ, μ_e ≈ m_e, so ratio (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nIn the initial statement, for the muon, since m_μ = 207 m_e, and for light nuclei, M_nuc is not much larger, but for heavy nuclei, it is.\n\nFor example, for lead, A=207, M_nuc ≈ 207 * 1836 m_e, so m_μ/M_nuc = 207 m_e / (207*1836 m_e) = 1/1836, very small, so μ_μ ≈ m_μ.\n\nSimilarly for electron, μ_e ≈ m_e.\n\nFor hydrogen, it's less accurate, but perhaps the problem assumes the approximation.\n\nIn the perturbation theory, the wavefunction is for point nucleus with reduced mass, so we should include it.\n\nBut let's look for the energy shift expression.\n\nI recall that the first-order energy shift for finite size is:\n\nΔE = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\left( \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\right) R^2 |\\psi(0)|^2\n\nFor s-states.\n\nWith |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z \\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} ? Let's see.\n\na = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2}, so \\frac{Z}{a} = Z \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z \\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} ? No.\n\nψ(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (Z/a)^{3/2} e^{-Zr/a}\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (Z/a)^{3/2} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (Z/a)^3\n\nAnd a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2}, so (1/a) = \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} Z^3 \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nThen ΔE = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} R^2 \\frac{1}{\\pi} Z^3 \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nSimplify.\n\nFor the ratio, ΔE_μ / ΔE_e, all terms are the same except μ.\n\nSpecifically, ΔE proportional to μ^3, because of the (μ e^2)^3 term.\n\nFrom above, ΔE ∝ μ^3 R^2, and R same, so ΔE ∝ μ^3.\n\nThus ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nWith μ_μ and μ_e as reduced masses.\n\nNow for the ratio, we have.\n\nBut in the problem, it asks for the ratio, and to express in terms of the parameters.\n\nPerhaps we can write the ratio as (m_μ / m_e)^3 times a correction factor.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince the nucleus is the same, M_nuc is fixed.\n\nSo μ_μ / μ_e = [ m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ] = (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nM_nuc = A m_p, with m_p proton mass.\n\nSo the ratio is [ (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + A m_p) / (m_μ + A m_p) ]^3\n\nNow m_p is a fundamental constant.\n\nIn the expression, we can write it.\n\nBut the problem might expect the simple form.\n\nAnother thing: in the energy shift, for the finite size, the formula I used assumes that the wavefunction is constant over the nucleus, which is valid when R << a, but for muon, a is smaller, so for heavy nuclei, R/a might not be small, but in perturbation theory, we still use the point nucleus wavefunction.\n\nFor the ratio, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since it's first-order perturbation, and for the ratio, the simple form is accepted.\n\nLet's assume that the reduced mass effect is negligible, so μ_μ = m_μ, μ_e = m_e, so ratio (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nThen the ratio is 207^3.\n\nBut to write it.\n\nThe problem says \"express in terms of ...\", so perhaps we need to include the masses.\n\nIn the Final-Box-Only, we need to put the expression.\n\nPerhaps the ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nBut let's see if there is Z or A dependence.\n\nFrom the expression, no.\n\nr_0 is for R, but R cancels.\n\nSo I think the ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nSo for the box, we can put \\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}\n\nBut m_μ and m_e are given, so it's fine.\n\nTo be precise, with fundamental constants, but it's a ratio.\n\nPerhaps they want the expression.\n\nAnother thought: in the perturbation, for the muon, since the Bohr radius is smaller, the approximation e^{-k r} ≈ 1 may not be as good for large Z, but for the ratio, it might cancel.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, I got a factor, but for the ratio, it should be the same.\n\nSo I think (m_μ / m_e)^3 is correct.\n\nSo the ratio \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}\n\nSo for the box, we put that.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nIn the FBO protocol, only the expression.\n\nSo \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}\n\nBut m_μ and m_e are symbols, so it should be fine.\n\nTo include the reduced mass, but I think for this problem, it's not necessary.\n\nThe problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and with the masses given, it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n",

Inside R, it's:\n\n\\( H'(r) = V_{\\text{finite}}(r) - V_{\\text{point}}(r) = -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{2R} \\left( 3 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) + \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( H'(r) = \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{2R} \\left( 3 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) \\right] \\) for r ≤ R.\n\nAnd H' = 0 for r > R.\n\nNow, the first-order energy shift is \\( \\Delta E = \\langle \\psi_{1s} | H' | \\psi_{1s} \\rangle \\)\n\nSince H' is only non-zero for r ≤ R, and for the 1s state, which is spherically symmetric, we can write:\n\n\\( \\Delta E = \\int_0^\\infty \\psi_{1s}^* H' \\psi_{1s} d^3 r = \\int_0^R \\psi_{1s}^2 H' 4\\pi r^2 dr \\) because the wavefunction is real.\n\nMore carefully: the probability density is \\( |\\psi|^2 \\), and d^3 r = 4\\pi r^2 dr for s-states.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\Delta E = \\int_0^R |\\psi_{1s}(r)|^2 H'(r) 4\\pi r^2 dr \\)\n\nNow, \\( \\psi_{1s}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a} \\), where a is the Bohr radius for the particle.\n\nSo \\( |\\psi_{1s}(r)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 e^{-2Z r / a} \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( \\Delta E = \\int_0^R \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 e^{-2Z r / a} \\right] H'(r) 4\\pi r^2 dr \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\Delta E = 4\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} H'(r) r^2 dr \\)\n\n\\( \\Delta E = 4 \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} H'(r) r^2 dr \\)\n\nNow plug in H'(r):\n\n\\( H'(r) = \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{2R} \\left( 3 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) \\right] \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\Delta E = 4 \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{3}{2R} + \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} \\right] r^2 dr \\)\n\nSimplify the expression inside:\n\nFirst, \\( 4 \\cdot \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 = \\frac{Ze^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a} \\right)^3 = \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^3} \\)\n\n4 / (4π ε0) = 1/(π ε0), yes.\n\nBut let's keep it as:\n\n\\( \\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^3} \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} \\left[ r - \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} r^4 \\right] dr \\)\n\nFrom above:\n\nThe term in brackets: \\( \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{3}{2R} + \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} \\right] r^2 dr = \\left[ r - \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} r^4 \\right] dr \\)\n\nYes.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\Delta E = \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^3} \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} \\left( r - \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} r^4 \\right) dr \\)\n\nFor the 1s state, the wavefunction is concentrated near r=0, and R is small because the nucleus is small. Typically, R << a, since a is on the order of 10^{-10} m, R is about 10^{-14} m for light nuclei, so R/a is very small. Therefore, we can approximate the exponential as 1, because r ≤ R << a, so 2Z r / a << 1.\n\nThat's a standard approximation for finite size correction.\n\nSo, \\( e^{-2Z r / a} \\approx 1 \\) for r ≤ R.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^3} \\int_0^R \\left( r - \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} r^4 \\right) dr \\)\n\nNow, integrate term by term.\n\nLet \\( I = \\int_0^R r \\, dr - \\frac{3}{2R} \\int_0^R r^2 \\, dr + \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\int_0^R r^4 \\, dr \\)\n\nCompute each:\n\n\\( \\int_0^R r \\, dr = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 \\)\n\n\\( \\int_0^R r^2 \\, dr = \\frac{1}{3} R^3 \\)\n\n\\( \\int_0^R r^4 \\, dr = \\frac{1}{5} R^5 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( I = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{3}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} R^3 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} R^5 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( I = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{3}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} R^3 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} R^5 = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{1}{2} R^2 + \\frac{1}{10} R^2 \\)\n\nCalculate:\n\nFirst term: \\( \\frac{1}{2} R^2 \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( -\\frac{3}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} R^3 = -\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} R^{2} = -\\frac{1}{2} R^2 \\)\n\nThird term: \\( \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} R^5 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} R^{2} = \\frac{1}{10} R^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( I = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{1}{2} R^2 + \\frac{1}{10} R^2 = \\frac{1}{10} R^2 \\)\n\nOh, nice!

Better to keep in terms of a_e.\n\nFrom ΔE_e = \\frac{2}{5} Z^4 \\frac{\\hbar^2 R^2}{m_e a_e^4}\n\nSimilarly for muon: m_μ = 207 m_e, a_μ = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_μ e^2} = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{207 m_e e^2} = \\frac{a_e}{207}\n\nBecause a_e = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}, so a_μ = a_e / 207\n\nNow, ΔE_μ = \\frac{2}{5} Z^4 \\frac{\\hbar^2 R^2}{m_μ a_μ^4}\n\nNow, the ratio \\frac{\\Delta E_μ}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{ \\frac{2}{5} Z^4 \\frac{\\hbar^2 R^2}{m_μ a_μ^4} }{ \\frac{2}{5} Z^4 \\frac{\\hbar^2 R^2}{m_e a_e^4} } = \\frac{ m_e a_e^4 }{ m_μ a_μ^4 } \\cdot \\frac{1}{m_μ} \\cdot m_e ?

But what about Z and A? They canceled out, which makes sense because the ratio should depend only on the masses, not on Z or A, since both particles see the same nuclear size and charge.\n\nBut R = r_0 A^{1/3}, but in the ratio, R cancels, and Z cancels, so only the masses matter.\n\nAnd m_μ = 207 m_e, so ratio is (207)^3.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nWe have \\frac{\\Delta E_μ}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{m_e a_e^4}{m_μ a_μ^4}\n\na_e = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}\n\na_μ = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_μ e^2}\n\nSo a_μ = a_e \\frac{m_e}{m_μ} , because a proportional to 1/m.\n\na_e / m_e = constant, no.\n\na_e = k / m_e, where k = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{e^2}\n\nSimilarly a_μ = k / m_μ\n\nSo a_μ = a_e \\frac{m_e}{m_μ} ? Let's see: a_e = k / m_e, so k = a_e m_e\n\nThen a_μ = k / m_μ = a_e m_e / m_μ\n\nYes, so a_μ = a_e \\frac{m_e}{m_μ}\n\nTherefore, a_μ^4 = \\left( a_e \\frac{m_e}{m_μ} \\right)^4 = a_e^4 \\frac{m_e^4}{m_μ^4}\n\nNow, back to ratio:\n\n\\frac{m_e a_e^4}{m_μ a_μ^4} = \\frac{m_e a_e^4}{m_μ \\cdot a_e^4 \\frac{m_e^4}{m_μ^4}} = \\frac{m_e a_e^4 m_μ^4}{m_μ a_e^4 m_e^4} = \\frac{m_μ^4}{m_μ m_e^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{m_e} ? Mess.\n\nFrom denominator: m_μ a_μ^4 = m_μ \\cdot a_e^4 \\frac{m_e^4}{m_μ^4} = a_e^4 \\frac{m_e^4}{m_μ^3}\n\nSo, \\frac{m_e a_e^4}{m_μ a_μ^4} = \\frac{m_e a_e^4}{ a_e^4 \\frac{m_e^4}{m_μ^3} } = \\frac{m_e m_μ^3}{m_e^4} = \\frac{m_μ^3}{m_e^3}\n\nAh, yes! Simpler.\n\nSo \\frac{\\Delta E_μ}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nSince m_μ = 207 m_e, so \\frac{\\Delta E_μ}{\\Delta E_e} = 207^3\n\nNow, is that the final answer? The problem asks for the ratio, and to express in terms of given parameters, but since it simplifies to just the mass ratio cubed, and others cancel, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check if I missed something.\n\nIn the approximation, we used e^{-2Z r / a} ≈ 1, which is valid when R << a.\n\nNow, for electron, a_e is about 5.29e-11 m, R is about 1.2e-15 A^{1/3} m, so for A=1, R≈1.2e-15, a_e=5.29e-11, ratio ~2e-5, very small. For muon, a_μ = a_e / 207 ≈ 2.56e-13 m, R for heavy nucleus, say A=200, R≈1.2e-15 * 200^{1/3} ≈ 1.2e-15 * 5.85 ≈ 7e-15 m. a_μ ≈ 2.56e-13, so R/a_μ ≈ 7e-15 / 2.56e-13 ≈ 0.027, still small, but not as small. For light nuclei, it might be okay, but for heavy, Z large, but in the exponent, 2Z r / a, for muon, a is smaller, so 2Z r / a might not be negligible for large Z.\n\nFor example, if Z=100, A≈250, R≈1.2e-15 * 250^{1/3} ≈1.2e-15*6.3≈7.6e-15 m, a_μ = a_e / 207 ≈ 5.29e-11 / 207 ≈ 2.56e-13 m, so 2Z r / a ≈ 2*100 * 7.6e-15 / 2.56e-13 ≈ 200 * 7.6e-15 / 2.56e-13 = 200 * 2.97e-2 ≈ 200*0.0297≈5.94, which is not small! e^{-6} is about 0.002, not negligible.\n\nOh, problem! For muonic atoms with high Z, the approximation e^{-2Z r / a} ≈1 is poor because the wavefunction is more spread out? No, for muon, a_μ is smaller, so the wavefunction is more compact, so r/a is larger, so for r up to R, 2Z r / a could be large.\n\nIn this case, for high Z, 2Z r / a_μ is large, so e^{-2Z r / a} is small, meaning that the energy shift might be overestimated by setting it to 1.\n\nBut in the ratio, since for electron it's still good, but for muon it's not, so the ratio might not be exactly (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nThe problem asks to use first-order perturbation with unperturbed wavefunctions, but doesn't specify to approximate the exponential. In fact, in the integral, we might need to keep it.\n\nBut typically for finite size, for electrons, it's approximated as constant, but for muons, sometimes it's not.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"using first-order perturbation theory with the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions\", so we should use the exact wavefunction, but the integral might be messy.\n\nIn the standard treatment, for the energy shift, when R << a, we use the approximation, but for muons, a is smaller, so perhaps for light nuclei it's ok, but the ratio might still hold.\n\nBut in my calculation above, for high Z, it might not.\n\nPerhaps for the ratio, we need to compute the integrals properly.\n\nBut the problem likely expects the simple ratio, as it's a common result.\n\nAnother way: the energy shift is proportional to the probability density at r=0 times R^2, but with the wavefunction.\n\nFor s-states, the shift is ΔE ≈ \\frac{2\\pi}{3} |\\psi(0)|^2 \\int_0^R r^2 (V_{\\text{finite}} - V_{\\text{point}}) dr or something, but I think I have it.\n\nIn my earlier expression, ΔE = \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^3} \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} \\left( r - \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} r^4 \\right) dr\n\nAnd with e^{-2Z r / a} ≈1, we got ΔE ∝ R^2 / a^4, and a ∝ 1/m, so ∝ m^4, and with m in denominator, so ∝ m^3, as I have.\n\nBut if we don't approximate, the integral depends on a, so on m.\n\nSpecifically, the integral I = \\int_0^R e^{-k r} (a r + b r^2 + c r^4) dr, with k=2Z/a.\n\nAnd k depends on a, which depends on m.\n\nSo for different particles, k is different.\n\nSpecifically, k = 2Z / a, and a ∝ 1/m, so k ∝ m.\n\nSince a ∝ 1/m, k ∝ m.\n\nSo for muon, k is larger.\n\nNow, in the integral, since R is small, but kR may not be small, we might need to compute it.\n\nBut the integral can be computed, as it's polynomial times exponential.\n\nIn fact, for the finite size shift, sometimes it's given as ΔE = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{Z^4 e^2 R^2}{a^3} \\frac{1}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)} something, but with the exponential approximated.\n\nTo be precise, let's define the integral.\n\nSet k = 2Z / a\n\nThen ΔE = \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^3} \\int_0^R e^{-k r} \\left( r - \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} r^4 \\right) dr\n\nFactor out constants.\n\nLet I(k) = \\int_0^R e^{-k r} \\left( r - \\frac{3}{2R} r^2 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} r^4 \\right) dr\n\nNow, this is a function of k and R.\n\nSince R is the same for both, but k is different.\n\nk depends on a, which depends on m.\n\nThe ratio \\frac{\\Delta E_μ}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{ \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a_μ^3} I(k_μ) }{ \\frac{Z^4 e^2}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 a_e^3} I(k_e) } = \\frac{a_e^3}{a_μ^3} \\frac{I(k_μ)}{I(k_e)}\n\nNow, a_μ = a_e \\frac{m_e}{m_μ} , since a ∝ 1/m\n\nSo \\frac{a_e^3}{a_μ^3} = \\left( \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nNow, I(k) = \\int_0^R e^{-k r} r dr - \\frac{3}{2R} \\int_0^R e^{-k r} r^2 dr + \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\int_0^R e^{-k r} r^4 dr\n\nEach integral can be computed using integration by parts or gamma function, but since upper limit is R, not infinity, it's incomplete gamma.\n\nBut for small kR, it's approximately the full integral, but for large, not.\n\nNote that the integrand is proportional to r^2 times a function, but let's compute the integrals.\n\nDefine J_n(k) = \\int_0^R e^{-k r} r^n dr\n\nThen I(k) = J_1(k) - \\frac{3}{2R} J_2(k) + \\frac{1}{2R^3} J_4(k)\n\nNow, J_n(k) = \\int_0^R e^{-k r} r^n dr\n\nThis can be written as \\frac{n!}{k^{n+1}} \\gamma(n+1, kR) or something, but actually, the incomplete gamma function.\n\nFor n integer, it can be computed.\n\nFor example, J_0(k) = \\int_0^R e^{-k r} dr = \\frac{1}{k} (1 - e^{-k R})\n\nJ_1(k) = \\int_0^R e^{-k r} r dr = -\\frac{r}{k} e^{-k r} \\big|_0^R + \\frac{1}{k} \\int_0^R e^{-k r} dr = -\\frac{R}{k} e^{-k R} + \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} (1 - e^{-k R}) = \\frac{1}{k^2} - \\frac{R}{k} e^{-k R} - \\frac{1}{k^2} e^{-k R} + \\frac{1}{k^2} ? Let's see:\n\n\\int r e^{-k r} dr, integration by parts: u=r, dv=e^{-kr} dr, du=dr, v= -1/k e^{-kr}\n\nSo [ - (r/k) e^{-kr} ]_0^R + (1/k) \\int e^{-kr} dr = - (R/k) e^{-k R} + 0 + (1/k) [ -1/k e^{-kr} ]_0^R = - (R/k) e^{-k R} - (1/k^2) e^{-k R} + 1/k^2\n\nSo J_1(k) = \\frac{1}{k^2} [1 - e^{-k R} (1 + k R) ]\n\nSimilarly, J_2(k) = \\int r^2 e^{-kr} dr\n\nu=r^2, dv=e^{-kr} dr, du=2r dr, v= -1/k e^{-kr}\n\nSo [ - (r^2 / k) e^{-kr} ]_0^R + (2/k) \\int r e^{-kr} dr = - (R^2 / k) e^{-k R} + (2/k) J_1(k)\n\n= - (R^2 / k) e^{-k R} + (2/k) \\frac{1}{k^2} [1 - e^{-k R} (1 + k R)] = - (R^2 / k) e^{-k R} + \\frac{2}{k^3} - \\frac{2}{k^3} e^{-k R} - \\frac{2}{k^2} R e^{-k R} \\frac{1}{k} ? \n\n(2/k) * [1/k^2 - (1/k^2) e^{-kR} (1 + kR) ] = \\frac{2}{k^3} - \\frac{2}{k^3} e^{-kR} (1 + kR)\n\nSo J_2(k) = - \\frac{R^2}{k} e^{-kR} + \\frac{2}{k^3} - \\frac{2}{k^3} e^{-kR} - \\frac{2}{k^3} kR e^{-kR} = \\frac{2}{k^3} - e^{-kR} \\left( \\frac{R^2}{k} + \\frac{2}{k^3} + \\frac{2R}{k^2} \\right)\n\nFrom above: - (R^2 / k) e^{-kR} + \\frac{2}{k^3} - \\frac{2}{k^3} e^{-kR} - \\frac{2}{k^3} kR e^{-kR} = \\frac{2}{k^3} - e^{-kR} \\left( \\frac{R^2}{k} + \\frac{2}{k^3} + \\frac{2R}{k^2} \\right)\n\n\\frac{2}{k^3} kR e^{-kR} is \\frac{2R}{k^2} e^{-kR}, yes.\n\nSo J_2(k) = \\frac{2}{k^3} - e^{-kR} \\left( \\frac{R^2}{k} + \\frac{2R}{k^2} + \\frac{2}{k^3} \\right)\n\nSimilarly, for J_4(k), it will be messy, but we can see the pattern.\n\nNow, in our case, for the ratio, when we have I(k), and for electron and muon, k_e and k_μ.\n\nk = 2Z / a, and a ∝ 1/m, so k ∝ m.\n\nAlso, R is fixed for a given nucleus.\n\nNow, for electron, k_e = 2Z / a_e, a_e large, so k_e small, k_e R <<1, so e^{-k_e R} ≈ 1 - k_e R + ..., and the integral approximately as before.\n\nFor muon, k_μ = 2Z / a_μ = 2Z / (a_e / 207) = 2Z * 207 / a_e = 207 k_e\n\nSo k_μ = 207 k_e\n\nNow, if k_e R <<1, then k_μ R = 207 k_e R, which could be large if k_e R is not too small, but for light nuclei, k_e R is small.\n\nFor example, for hydrogen, Z=1, A=1, R≈1.2e-15 m, a_e=5.29e-11, k_e = 2Z/a_e ≈ 2/5.29e-11 ≈ 3.78e10 m^{-1}, k_e R ≈ 3.78e10 * 1.2e-15 = 4.54e-5, very small, so e^{-k_e R}≈1, and similarly for muon, k_μ=207 k_e ≈207*3.78e10≈7.83e12, R same, k_μ R≈7.83e12*1.2e-15≈9.4e-3, still small, e^{-9.4e-3}≈0.99, so approximation good.\n\nFor heavier nucleus, say Z=20, A=40, R≈1.2e-15 * 40^{1/3}≈1.2e-15*3.42≈4.1e-15 m, a_e same, k_e=2*20/5.29e-11≈40/5.29e-11≈7.56e11, k_e R≈7.56e11*4.1e-15≈3.1e-3, small. k_μ=207*7.56e11≈1.57e14, k_μ R≈1.57e14*4.1e-15≈0.643, e^{-0.643}≈0.526, not 1, so error.\n\nBut in this case, for muon, the exponential is not 1, so we need to compute.\n\nHowever, in the ratio, since for electron it's still good, but for muon not, so the simple ratio may not hold.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of this problem, they want the approximation.\n\nMaybe the ratio is still approximately (m_μ/m_e)^3, but let's see.\n\nAnother thought: in the expression for ΔE, the dominant term might be such that the ratio is still mass ratio cubed.\n\nBut let's look back at I(k).\n\nIn the limit of small R, I(k) ≈ \\int_0^R r dr - ... as before, which gave R^2/10, independent of k, so ratio is (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nBut when kR is not small, I(k) depends on k.\n\nFor example, if k is large, the exponential decays fast, so I(k) is smaller.\n\nIn particular, for fixed R, as k increases, I(k) decreases.\n\nIn our case, for muon, k is larger, so I(k_μ) < I(k_e) when k_μ > k_e, which is true, so ΔE_μ is smaller than if exponential were 1.\n\nBut in the ratio, since we have I(k_μ)/I(k_e), and for muon I(k) is smaller, so the ratio should be less than (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation for Z=20, k_μ R ≈0.643, so e^{-k r} at r=R is about 0.526, and since the integrand is peaked at r=0, but still, the average might be less.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, the problem assumes the approximation.\n\nI recall that in some texts, for finite size, the energy shift for s-states is proportional to |ψ(0)|^2 R^2, and |ψ(0)| for 1s is proportional to (Z/a)^{3/2}, and a ∝ 1/m, so |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ (Z^3 / a^3) ∝ Z^3 m^3\n\nThen ΔE ∝ |ψ(0)|^2 R^2 ∝ m^3 R^2\n\nR same, so ratio ∝ (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nAnd the constant is the same, so ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nIn the perturbation, the shift is <ψ| H' |ψ>, and H' is proportional to some average, but in the approximation where H' is constant or something, but in our case, when we set exponential to 1, it worked.\n\nPerhaps for the ratio, it's standard to use that.\n\nMoreover, in the problem, it says \"using first-order perturbation theory\", and \"unperturbed wavefunctions\", but doesn't specify to approximate, but in practice, for the ratio, it might be fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's compute I(k) for both.\n\nBut I(k) depends on k and R, and for different particles, k different, but R same.\n\nBut in the ratio \\frac{\\Delta E_μ}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} \\right)^3 \\frac{I(k_μ)}{I(k_e)}\n\nk_μ = 2Z / a_μ, k_e = 2Z / a_e, and a_μ / a_e = m_e / m_μ, so k_μ / k_e = a_e / a_μ = m_μ / m_e\n\nSet ρ = m_μ / m_e = 207\n\nSo k_μ = ρ k_e\n\nNow, I(k) = J_1(k) - \\frac{3}{2R} J_2(k) + \\frac{1}{2R^3} J_4(k)\n\nWith J_n(k) as above.\n\nFor the electron, k_e R is small, so I(k_e) ≈ \\frac{1}{10} R^2, as before.\n\nFor muon, I(k_μ) = I(ρ k_e)\n\nSince k_e R small, but ρ k_e R may not be small.\n\nHowever, if we assume that for both, we use the approximation, then I(k) ≈ \\frac{1}{10} R^2 for both, so ratio is ρ^3.\n\nBut if we compute exactly, it's different.\n\nPerhaps for the problem, since it's \"first-order perturbation\", and \"unperturbed wavefunctions\", we should use the exact wavefunction, but in the integral, we can leave it, but the ratio might not simplify.\n\nBut the problem asks for a closed-form expression, and to express in terms of the parameters, but if we have to include the exponential, it's not closed-form.\n\nMoreover, in the answer, it should be simplified.\n\nI think for this context, the expected answer is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nPerhaps in the ratio, the dependence on Z and A cancels, and only mass ratio.\n\nAnother way: the energy shift ΔE is proportional to the expectation value, and for the 1s state, it's proportional to |ψ(0)|^2 times the mean value of H' , but H' is not constant.\n\nBut in the small R limit, H' is approximately constant in the region where ψ is constant, but ψ varies.\n\nBut in our calculation, when we set e^{-2Z r / a} =1, we got a result.\n\nI recall that in quantum mechanics books, the finite size shift for s-states is given as ΔE = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{(Ze^2)^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{R^2}{a^3} \\times something, but let's see.\n\nFrom my earlier expression, with approximation, ΔE = \\frac{2}{5} Z^4 \\frac{\\hbar^2 R^2}{m a^4}\n\nAnd since a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2}, so a^4 = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m e^2} \\right)^4, so \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m a^4} = \\hbar^2 / m \\cdot \\frac{m^4 e^8}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^4 \\hbar^8} = \\frac{m^3 e^8}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^4 \\hbar^6}\n\nBut in terms of ground state energy, but for ratio, it's simpler as before.\n\nFor the ratio, \\frac{\\Delta E_μ}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nAnd since m_μ = 207 m_e, so 207^3.\n\nThe problem asks to express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants, but since it simplifies, and no dependence on others, it should be fine.\n\nMoreover, in the box, we can just put 207^3, but m_μ and m_e are given, so perhaps write \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nBut in the FBO format, bare expression.\n\n207 is given, m_μ = 207 m_e, so we can use 207.\n\nBut to be general, it's (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nIn the answer, since it's a ratio, and simplified, I think \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 is fine, but in LaTeX.\n\nIn the box, bare expression, so probably \\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}\n\nBut the problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and this is closed-form.\n\nPerhaps they want the numerical value, but no, since m_μ and m_e are symbols.\n\nThe ratio is \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nAnd since m_μ = 207 m_e, but in the expression, we can leave it as is.\n\nIn the box, we need to write the expression.\n\nNow, for the FBO, only one box with the expression.\n\nSo I think it's \\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}\n\nBut is that correct? Earlier I saw that for high Z, it might not be accurate, but for the problem, it should be accepted.\n\nPerhaps include the constants, but they cancel.\n\nAnother thought: in the Bohr radius, for the hydrogen-like atom, the reduced mass is used, but since the nucleus is heavy, μ ≈ m, the particle mass, so it's fine.\n\nIn the wavefunction, it's exact for reduced mass, but for energy shift, same thing.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nSo the ratio is \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nSo for the final answer.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the expression.\n\nWe have \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nYes.\n\nSo in LaTeX: \\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}\n\nIn the FBO protocol, only the expression, no words.\n\nSo \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}\n\nBut is there a comma? No, single expression.\n\nBut the problem says \"the ratio\", so one expression.\n\nPerhaps they want it in terms of numbers, but no, m_μ and m_e are given.\n\nSince m_μ = 207 m_e, we could write 207^3, but I think it's better to keep symbolic.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\", but in this case, only m_μ and m_e appear, others cancel.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nIf they insist on including others, but it's zero.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n",

        "reasoning": "First, the problem is about finding the ratio of energy shifts for an electron and a muon due to the finite size of the nucleus. The nucleus has atomic number Z and mass number A, with radius R = r₀ A^{1/3}. The electron has mass m_e, and the muon has mass m_μ = 207 m_e. Both are in the 1s state.\n\nThe energy shift is calculated using first-order perturbation theory with unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus. The perturbation is due to the finite nuclear size.\n\nFor a hydrogen-like atom, the unperturbed wavefunction for the 1s state is:\n\n\\[\\psi_{1s}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a_\\mu}\\]\n\nwhere a_μ is the Bohr radius for the reduced mass. For a particle of mass m bound to a nucleus of mass M, the reduced mass μ is approximately m if M >> m, but here since the nucleus is much heavier, we can take μ ≈ m for both electron and muon. However, for precision, in hydrogen-like atoms, the Bohr radius depends on the reduced mass.\n\nThe standard Bohr radius a_0 is for an electron with infinite nuclear mass: a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}.\n\nFor a particle of mass m, the Bohr radius is scaled: a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2} where μ is the reduced mass.

For r < R:\n\nΔH(r) = V_finite(r) - V_point(r) = \\left[ - \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Ze^2}{2R} \\left( 3 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) \\right] - \\left[ - \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Ze^2}{r} \\right] = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{2R} \\left( 3 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) \\right]\n\nSimplify that:\n\nΔH(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{3}{2R} + \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} \\right) for r < R, and 0 for r ≥ R.\n\nThe first-order energy shift is ΔE = <ψ| ΔH |ψ>, where ψ is the unperturbed wavefunction.\n\nFor the 1s state, ψ is spherically symmetric, so we can integrate in spherical coordinates.\n\nSo, ΔE = ∫ ψ* ΔH ψ dV = ∫_0^∞ ψ^2(r) ΔH(r) 4π r^2 dr\n\nSince ψ is real.\n\nNow, ΔH is zero for r ≥ R, so the integral is only from 0 to R.\n\nSo, ΔE = ∫_0^R [ψ(r)]^2 ΔH(r) 4π r^2 dr\n\nPlug in ψ(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a_\\mu}\n\nSo [ψ(r)]^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} e^{-2Z r / a_\\mu}\n\nAnd dV = 4π r^2 dr, so the integral becomes:\n\nΔE = ∫_0^R \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} e^{-2Z r / a_\\mu} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{3}{2R} + \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} \\right) 4π r^2 dr\n\nSimplify constants.\n\nFirst, \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\cdot 4π = 4, so:\n\nΔE = ∫_0^R 4 \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} e^{-2Z r / a_\\mu} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{3}{2R} + \\frac{r^2}{2R^3} \\right) r^2 dr\n\nThe 4 and 1/4 cancel?

Notice that \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} e^2 is related to the Bohr radius.\n\nRecall that the Bohr radius a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}, so \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2 a_0}\n\nBut here we have different masses for electron and muon.\n\nSet k = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}, so k Ze^2.\n\nAnd a_μ is the Bohr radius for mass m, so a_μ = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{k \\mu e^2}, since k = 1/(4πϵ0)\n\nStandard: a_μ = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2}\n\nSo \\frac{1}{a_μ} = \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}\n\nNow, back to ΔE.\n\nΔE = k Ze^2 \\cdot 4 \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a_\\mu} \\left( r - \\frac{3r^2}{2R} + \\frac{r^4}{2R^3} \\right) dr\n\nSimplify the constant: 4 k Ze^2 Z^3 / a_μ^3 = 4 k Z^4 e^2 / a_μ^3\n\nNow, since a_μ = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{k \\mu e^2}, so 1/a_μ = \\frac{k \\mu e^2}{\\hbar^2}\n\nThus, 1/a_μ^3 = \\left( \\frac{k \\mu e^2}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nSo plug in:\n\n4 k Z^4 e^2 / a_μ^3 = 4 k Z^4 e^2 \\left( \\frac{k \\mu e^2}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^3 = 4 k Z^4 e^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^3 \\mu^3 e^6}{\\hbar^6} = 4 k^4 Z^4 \\mu^3 e^8 / \\hbar^6\n\nThis is messy. Perhaps better to express in terms of known quantities.\n\nI recall that for the point nucleus, the ground state energy is E = - \\frac{\\mu e^4}{2 (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2} Z^2, but for the shift, we can keep it as is.\n\nThe integral needs to be evaluated. Since R is small, and a_μ is larger, but for muons, a_μ is smaller because m_μ is larger.\n\na_μ proportional to 1/μ, so for muon, since m_μ > m_e, a_μ < a_e.\n\nBut R is the same for both, since same nucleus.\n\nThe key point is that for r << a_μ, the exponential is approximately 1, because e^{-2Z r / a_μ} ≈ 1 when r is small.\n\nSince R is the nuclear radius, which is about 10^{-15} m, while atomic sizes are 10^{-10} m, so Z r / a_μ << 1 for r < R, so indeed e^{-2Z r / a_μ} ≈ 1.\n\nThis is a standard approximation for finite size corrections.\n\nSo, we can set e^{-2Z r / a_\\mu} ≈ 1 for the range of integration.\n\nThus, ΔE ≈ \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\cdot 4 \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} \\int_0^R \\left( r - \\frac{3r^2}{2R} + \\frac{r^4}{2R^3} \\right) dr\n\nNow, integrate term by term.\n\nLet I = \\int_0^R \\left( r - \\frac{3r^2}{2R} + \\frac{r^4}{2R^3} \\right) dr\n\nCompute the antiderivative.\n\n∫ r dr = (1/2) r^2\n\n∫ r^2 dr = (1/3) r^3\n\n∫ r^4 dr = (1/5) r^5\n\nSo,\n\nI = [ \\frac{1}{2} r^2 - \\frac{3}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} r^3 + \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} r^5 ]_0^R\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ \\frac{1}{2} r^2 - \\frac{1}{2R} r^3 + \\frac{1}{10 R^3} r^5 ]_0^R\n\nAt r=R:\n\n= \\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{1}{2R} R^3 + \\frac{1}{10 R^3} R^5 = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{1}{2} R^2 + \\frac{1}{10} R^2 = 0 + \\frac{1}{10} R^2\n\nAt r=0, all zero.\n\nSo I = \\frac{1}{10} R^2\n\nIs that right?\n\n\\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{1}{2R} * R^3 = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 - \\frac{1}{2} R^2 = 0\n\nThen \\frac{1}{10 R^3} * R^5 = \\frac{1}{10} R^2\n\nYes, so I = \\frac{R^2}{10}\n\nNow, back to ΔE:\n\nΔE ≈ \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\cdot 4 \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} \\cdot \\frac{R^2}{10}\n\nSimplify:\n\n= \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{10} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} R^2\n\n= \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} Z^3 a_\\mu^{-3} R^2\n\n= \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Z^4 e^2 R^2 a_\\mu^{-3}\n\nNow, recall that a_\\mu = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2}\n\nSo a_\\mu^{-3} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nPlug in:\n\nΔE ≈ \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Z^4 e^2 R^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nSet k = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}, so\n\nΔE ≈ \\frac{2}{5} k Z^4 e^2 R^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{k \\hbar^2} \\right)^3 ?

We can write it as:\n\nΔE ≈ \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{1}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^4} Z^4 \\mu^3 e^8 R^2 / \\hbar^6 ? k^4 = [1/(4πϵ0)]^4\n\nBut perhaps better to relate to the Bohr radius.\n\nI recall that the unperturbed energy is E_0 = - \\frac{\\mu e^4}{2 (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2} Z^2\n\nBut for the shift, we can leave it.\n\nNow, the ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e\n\nΔE_e is for electron, ΔE_μ for muon.\n\nSo ΔE_e ≈ \\frac{2}{5} k^4 Z^4 \\mu_e^3 e^8 R^2 / \\hbar^6\n\nWhere μ_e ≈ m_e, since nucleus is heavy.\n\nSimilarly, for muon, μ_μ ≈ m_μ.\n\nR is the same for both, since same nucleus.\n\nZ is same.\n\nNow, k, e, ħ are constants.\n\nSo the ratio:\n\n\\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\frac{ \\frac{2}{5} k^4 Z^4 \\mu_\\mu^3 e^8 R^2 / \\hbar^6 }{ \\frac{2}{5} k^4 Z^4 \\mu_e^3 e^8 R^2 / \\hbar^6 } = \\frac{ \\mu_\\mu^3 }{ \\mu_e^3 }\n\nSince all other terms cancel.\n\nμ_μ is the reduced mass for muon, which is approximately m_μ, and μ_e for electron is m_e, since nucleus is heavy.\n\nSo \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nBut m_μ = 207 m_e, so it should be (207)^3.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio in terms of the parameters, but this seems too simple, and I think I missed something.\n\nIn the expression, a_μ depends on μ, and in ΔE, we have a_μ^{-3}, which is proportional to μ^3, as above.\n\nBut is the approximation valid? For muon, since m_μ is larger, a_μ is smaller, so Z r / a_μ might not be small for r up to R.\n\nFor electron, a_e ≈ a_0 ≈ 5.29e-11 m, R ≈ r_0 A^{1/3}, r_0 ≈ 1.2e-15 m, A for hydrogen is 1, but Z=1, A=1, R≈1.2e-15, a_e=5.29e-11, so R / a_e ≈ 1.2e-15 / 5.29e-11 ≈ 2.27e-5, so Z r / a_e ≤ Z R / a_e, for Z=1, about 2e-5, so e^{-2Z r / a_e} ≈ 1 - 2Z r / a_e + ..., and since 2Z r / a_e <<1, it's fine.\n\nFor muon, m_μ = 207 m_e, so a_μ = a_0 m_e / m_μ = a_0 / 207 ≈ 5.29e-11 / 207 ≈ 2.56e-13 m.\n\nR ≈ 1.2e-15 m for A=1, but R depends on A, but for a given nucleus, same R.\n\nSo R / a_μ ≈ 1.2e-15 / 2.56e-13 ≈ 0.0047, so Z r / a_μ ≤ Z R / a_μ, for Z=1, about 0.0047, so e^{-2Z r / a_μ} ≈ e^{-0.0094} ≈ 0.9906, which is still close to 1, and the correction might be small, but the approximation should be reasonable.\n\nThe problem says \"using first-order perturbation theory\", and this approximation is standard.\n\nBut in the ratio, I got \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3 = 207^3\n\nBut the problem asks to express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants.\n\nIn my expression, it only depends on m_μ / m_e, and since m_μ = 207 m_e, it's constant, but for general, it would be (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nBut is that correct? In the reduced mass, for muon, μ_μ = \\frac{m_μ M}{m_μ + M} ≈ m_μ (1 - m_μ / M), but since M, nuclear mass, is large, μ_μ ≈ m_μ, similarly for electron.\n\nBut M is the same for both, so the ratio should still be (m_μ / m_e)^3, since the correction is small.\n\nIn the expression ΔE ∝ μ^3, and μ ∝ m, so yes.\n\nBut let me check the formula again.\n\nFrom earlier: ΔE ≈ \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Z^4 e^2 R^2 a_\\mu^{-3}\n\nAnd a_\\mu = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2}, so a_\\mu^{-3} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nSo ΔE ≈ \\frac{2}{5} k Z^4 e^2 R^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{k \\hbar^2} \\right)^3 = \\frac{2}{5} k Z^4 e^2 R^2 \\frac{\\mu^3 e^6}{k^3 \\hbar^6} = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{\\mu^3 e^8 R^2 Z^4}{k^2 \\hbar^6}\n\nk = 1/(4πϵ0), so k^2 = 1/(4πϵ0)^2\n\nNow, the unperturbed energy for 1s is E_0 = - \\frac{\\mu e^4}{2 (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2} Z^2 = - \\frac{\\mu e^4}{2 k^2 \\hbar^2} Z^2\n\nBut for the shift, it's proportional to μ^3.\n\nIn the ratio, R is the same, Z same, so ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [μ_μ / μ_e]^3\n\nAnd μ_μ ≈ m_μ, μ_e ≈ m_e, so (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nThe problem gives m_μ = 207 m_e, so numerically it's 207^3, but it says \"express in terms of\", so probably leave it as (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nBut let me see if there's a dependence on Z or A.\n\nR = r_0 A^{1/3}, but in the ratio, R is the same for both since same nucleus, so it cancels out.\n\nSimilarly, r_0 and A are given, but they cancel in the ratio.\n\nSo indeed, \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nBut is that the final answer?\n\nI think I missed something. In the wavefunction, for the electron and muon, the Bohr radius is different, and in the approximation, we set the exponential to 1, but for the muon, since a_μ is smaller, the wavefunction is more spread out? No, for muon, smaller a_μ means the wavefunction is more compact, higher density near nucleus.\n\nIn fact, in the integral, since we approximated e^{-2Z r / a_μ} ≈1, and the rest is polynomial, and we got I proportional to R^2, but actually, for smaller a_μ, the wavefunction varies more rapidly, but in this case, since we approximated the exponential as constant, it should be fine as long as the argument is small.\n\nBut in the ratio, since both are approximated similarly, it should be ok.\n\nTo be precise, if I don't approximate, the integral would be more complex, but in first-order perturbation, with the approximation, it's standard.\n\nAnother way to think: the energy shift is proportional to the probability density at r=0 times the mean square radius or something.\n\nFor 1s state, |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^3\n\nAnd the perturbation ΔH, when averaged, is roughly proportional to R^2, since the potential difference is like r^2 inside.\n\nIn fact, in my calculation, ΔE ≈ constant * |ψ(0)|^2 * R^2\n\nBecause |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (Z / a_\\mu)^3\n\nAnd in the integral, we had ∫ ΔH ψ^2 dV ≈ |ψ(0)|^2 ∫ ΔH dV, since ψ almost constant.\n\nAnd ∫ ΔH dV, but ΔH is not constant, but in my earlier calculation, I integrated and got I = R^2 /10, and with ψ^2 constant, so ΔE ∝ |ψ(0)|^2 R^2\n\nNow, |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ (Z / a_\\mu)^3 ∝ Z^3 μ^{3} , since a_\\mu ∝ 1/μ\n\na_\\mu ∝ 1/μ, so |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ μ^3\n\nThus ΔE ∝ μ^3 R^2\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo for same nucleus, R same, so ΔE ∝ μ^3\n\nThus ratio (μ_μ / μ_e)^3 ≈ (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nNow, μ_μ = \\frac{m_μ M}{m_μ + M}, μ_e = \\frac{m_e M}{m_e + M}, where M is nuclear mass.\n\nM is large, but for precision, the ratio \\frac{\\mu_\\mu}{\\mu_e} = \\frac{m_μ M / (m_μ + M) }{ m_e M / (m_e + M) } = \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} \\frac{m_e + M}{m_μ + M}\n\nSince M >> m_e, m_μ (m_μ = 207 m_e ≈ 207 * 0.511 MeV/c² ≈ 106 MeV/c², while for light nucleus, say carbon, M=12*931≈11 GeV, much larger, so m_μ + M ≈ M, m_e + M ≈ M, so \\frac{\\mu_\\mu}{\\mu_e} ≈ \\frac{m_μ}{m_e}\n\nThus ratio ≈ (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nThe problem asks to express in terms of parameters, and m_μ and m_e are given, so probably \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nBut let me confirm the mass: m_μ = 207 m_e is given, so it's a number, but in the expression, we can write it.\n\nPerhaps they want the expression.\n\nIn the ratio, it should be dimensionless.\n\nNow, the question is to find \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e}, and I have it as (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nBut is there any Z or A dependence? In this approximation, no, because R canceled, and Z canceled.\n\nBut for larger Z, the approximation might be worse, but according to the calculation, it should be independent.\n\nPerhaps I need to include the exact integral.\n\nSuppose I don't approximate the exponential.\n\nThen ΔE = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} Ze^2 \\cdot 4 \\left( \\frac{Z}{a_\\mu} \\right)^{3} \\int_0^R e^{-2Z r / a_\\mu} \\left( r - \\frac{3r^2}{2R} + \\frac{r^4}{2R^3} \\right) dr\n\nSet α = 2Z / a_\\mu\n\nSo integral J = \\int_0^R e^{-α r} \\left( r - \\frac{3r^2}{2R} + \\frac{r^4}{2R^3} \\right) dr\n\nFor small αR, it's approximately J ≈ \\int_0^R (r - ...) dr as before.\n\nBut to be precise, J = \\int_0^R e^{-α r} r dr - \\frac{3}{2R} \\int_0^R e^{-α r} r^2 dr + \\frac{1}{2R^3} \\int_0^R e^{-α r} r^4 dr\n\nEach integral can be computed using integration by parts or gamma function.\n\nFor example, \\int_0^R e^{-α r} r^n dr for n=1,2,4.\n\nThe general form is related to incomplete gamma, but for small αR, we can expand.\n\nSince αR <<1, e^{-αr} ≈ 1 - αr + \\frac{(αr)^2}{2} - ... \n\nBut in my case, α = 2Z / a_\\mu, R is small, but for muon, αR might not be negligible.\n\nIn the ratio, it might have a small correction.\n\nBut I think for the problem, the approximation is sufficient.\n\nNotice that in the expression for ΔE, it has a_\\mu in the exponential, so for different particles, a_\\mu is different.\n\nBut in the ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e, since R and Z same, but a_μ different.\n\nIn my earlier approximation, I set exp=1, so no dependence.\n\nBut if I compute exactly, it might depend.\n\nHowever, in the standard treatment, the approximation is used, and the ratio is taken as (μ / reduced mass)^3.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects that.\n\nAnother way: the energy shift is proportional to the square of the wavefunction at origin times the mean square radius of the nucleus.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 for 1s is proportional to (Z / a_\\mu)^3 ∝ μ^3\n\nAnd for uniform sphere, the mean square radius is \\frac{3}{5} R^2 or something, but in the perturbation, it's not exactly that.\n\nIn my calculation, I got ΔE ∝ |ψ(0)|^2 R^2, and since |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ μ^3, R same, so ratio (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nNow, the problem gives r_0 and A, but in the ratio, they cancel.\n\nSo I think \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nGiven m_μ = 207 m_e, so numerically 207^3, but since it says \"express in terms of\", probably write the expression.\n\nBut in the FBO, I need to output only the expression.\n\nThe ratio is \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nPerhaps they want it simplified.\n\nm_μ and m_e are given, so it's fine.\n\nBut in the box, I need a single expression.\n\nNow, the ratio is a number, but it should be in terms of the symbols.\n\nThe problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\"\n\nIn my expression, it only depends on m_μ and m_e, not on Z, A, r_0.\n\nIs that correct? I think so, because for a given nucleus, the shift for each depends on their masses, but not on Z or A, except through R, but R cancels in ratio.\n\nSimilarly, r_0 and A are not needed.\n\nSo probably \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nTo confirm, for hydrogen-like atoms, the finite size shift is indeed proportional to μ^3 for the same nuclear size.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the ratio is \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nNow, for the FBO, I need to output only the box with the expression.\n\nSo \\boxed{ \\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3} }\n\nBut in LaTeX.\n\nThe problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and this is it.\n\nBut let me make sure about the reduced mass.\n\nIn the unperturbed wavefunction, for hydrogen-like, the Bohr radius uses reduced mass.\n\nIn the perturbation, we used that.\n\nAnd since the nucleus is the same, reduced mass ratio is approximately m_μ / m_e.\n\nTo be precise, μ = \\frac{m m_N}{m + m_N}, so for electron, μ_e = \\frac{m_e m_N}{m_e + m_N}, for muon μ_μ = \\frac{m_μ m_N}{m_μ + m_N}, so ratio \\frac{\\mu_\\mu}{\\mu_e} = \\frac{m_μ (m_e + m_N) }{ m_e (m_μ + m_N) } = \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} \\frac{1 + m_e / m_N}{1 + m_μ / m_N}\n\nSince m_N >> m_μ > m_e, m_μ / m_N <<1, m_e / m_N <<1, so approximately \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} (1 + \\frac{m_e}{m_N} ) (1 - \\frac{m_μ}{m_N} ) ≈ \\frac{m_μ}{m_e} (1 + \\frac{m_e - m_μ}{m_N} )\n\nBut since m_μ and m_e are fixed, and m_N depends on A, but for the ratio of energy shifts, it would have a small correction depending on m_N, hence on A.\n\nBut typically, this is neglected, and since the problem likely assumes the approximation, I think (m_μ / m_e)^3 is fine.\n\nIn the expression, if I include, it would be messy and depend on A.\n\nBut the problem asks to express in terms of A, etc., but in my case, it doesn't depend, so probably not needed.\n\nPerhaps for the wavefunction, they use infinite nuclear mass approximation.\n\nIn many contexts, they do.\n\nI think it's standard to take μ ≈ m.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nThus the ratio is \\left( \\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e} \\right)^3\n\nNow for FBO, output only the box.\n\nSo final answer.\n",

    "reasoning": "First, the problem is about finding the ratio of energy shifts for an electron and a muon due to the finite size of the nucleus. The nucleus has atomic number Z and mass number A, with radius R = r₀ A^{1/3}. The energy shifts are for the 1s state, and we're using first-order perturbation theory with hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus.\n\nThe energy shift due to finite nuclear size for a hydrogen-like atom is given by the first-order perturbation theory. The perturbation Hamiltonian ΔH is the difference between the actual potential and the point nucleus potential.\n\nFor a point nucleus, the potential is V_point(r) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/r.\n\nFor a uniform spherical charge distribution of radius R, the potential inside the sphere is different. For r ≤ R, V_finite(r) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/(2R) * (3 - (r²/R²)), and for r > R, it's the same as point nucleus, but since the wavefunction is concentrated near the nucleus, we care about the inside part for the shift.\n\nThe perturbation ΔV = V_finite - V_point.\n\nSpecifically, for r ≤ R, ΔV(r) = V_finite(r) - V_point(r) = [ - (Ze²)/(8πε₀ R) (3 - r²/R²) ] - [ - (Ze²)/(4πε₀ r) ] = (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -1/(2R) (3 - r²/R²) + 1/r ]\n\nLet me compute that carefully.\n\nV_point(r) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/r\n\nV_finite(r) for r ≤ R: - (1/(4πε₀)) * (Ze²)/(2R) * (3 - r²/R²)\n\nSo ΔV(r) = V_finite - V_point = - (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * [1/(2R) (3 - r²/R²) - 1/r]\n\n= (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -1/(2R) (3 - r²/R²) + 1/r ]\n\n= (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ]\n\nNow, the first-order energy shift is ΔE = <ψ| ΔV |ψ>, where ψ is the unperturbed wavefunction for the point nucleus.\n\nFor the 1s state, the hydrogen-like wavefunction is ψ(r) = (1/√π) * (Z/a)^(3/2) * e^{-Zr/a}, where a is the Bohr radius for the particle.\n\nThe Bohr radius depends on the reduced mass. For a particle of mass m bound to a nucleus of mass M_nuc, the reduced mass μ = m M_nuc / (m + M_nuc). But since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron or muon, M_nuc >> m, so μ ≈ m.\n\nThe mass number A is large, so for both electron and muon, the reduced mass is approximately m_e or m_μ, respectively.\n\nSo for electron, μ_e ≈ m_e, Bohr radius a_e = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_e e²)\n\nSimilarly for muon, μ_μ ≈ m_μ, Bohr radius a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ²) / (m_μ e²)\n\nThe wavefunction for 1s state: ψ(r) = (1/√π) (Z/a)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a}\n\nWhere a is the Bohr radius for that particle.\n\nNow, the energy shift ΔE = ∫ ψ* ΔV ψ dV\n\nSince it's spherically symmetric, we can integrate over angles.\n\ndV = 4π r² dr\n\nSo ΔE = ∫_0^∞ ψ^2(r) ΔV(r) 4π r² dr\n\nBut ΔV(r) is zero for r > R, because outside, V_finite = V_point, so ΔV=0 for r > R.\n\nFor r > R, V_finite = V_point, so ΔV=0.\n\nTherefore, the integral is only from 0 to R.\n\nSo ΔE = ∫_0^R [ψ(r)]^2 ΔV(r) 4π r² dr\n\nNow ψ(r) = (1/√π) (Z/a)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a}\n\nSo [ψ(r)]^2 = [1/π] (Z/a)^3 e^{-2Z r / a}\n\nBecause (1/√π)^2 = 1/π.\n\nNow, ΔV(r) = (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ]\n\nAs I had earlier.\n\nSo let's write ΔE = ∫_0^R [1/π (Z/a)^3 e^{-2Z r / a}] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] * 4π r² dr\n\nSimplify: the π in denominator and 4π in numerator, so 4π / π = 4.\n\nΔE = [1/π (Z/a)^3] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] r² dr\n\nSimplify constants: 1/π * 4π = 4, and 4 in numerator, so 4/4 =1? Let's see:\n\n[1/π] * [1/(4π ε₀)] * 4π = [1/π] * 4π * [1/(4π ε₀)] = 4 * [1/(4π ε₀)] = 1/(π ε₀)? No.\n\nConstants: (Ze²)/(4πε₀) is there, and then multiplied by 4π from dV, and the 1/π from ψ^2.\n\nSo overall constant: [1/π] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π = [1/π] * 4π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 1?  [1/π] * 4π = 4, so 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀) * 1/4? Let's compute:\n\n[1/π] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π = [1/π] * 4π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = 4 * (1/π) * π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) better:\n\n(1/π) * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π = (1/π) * 4π * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (4/4) * (Ze²)/(πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀)\n\n4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (4/4) * (Ze²)/(πε₀) = 1 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀)\n\nBut we also have the (Z/a)^3 from ψ^2.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nSo constants include (Z/a)^3 as well.\n\nSo let's write:\n\nΔE = [1/π (Z/a)^3] * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4π ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] r² dr\n\nNow, [1/π] * 4π = 4, so:\n\n= (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) * 4 ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] r² dr\n\nSimplify: (Z/a)^3 * 4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) * (1/1) since 4/4=1\n\n4 * (Ze²)/(4πε₀) = (Ze²)/(πε₀), yes.\n\nSo ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} r² [ -3/(2R) + r²/(2R³) + 1/r ] dr\n\nNow, let's distribute r²:\n\n= (Z/a)^3 * (Ze²)/(πε₀) ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ -3/(2R) r² + (r⁴)/(2R³) + r ] dr\n\nBecause r² * [ -3/(2R) ] = -3/(2R) r²\n\nr² * (r²)/(2R³) = r⁴/(2R³)\n\nr² * (1/r) = r\n\nSo the integral is ∫_0^R e^{-2Z r / a} [ r - (3/(2R)) r² + (1/(2R³)) r⁴ ] dr\n\nFrom above: [ -3/(2R) r² + (r⁴)/(2R³) + r ]\n\nSo ∫ e^{-k r} [ c1 r + c2 r² + c3 r⁴ ] dr with k = 2Z/a\n\nBut since R is small, and for 1s state, the wavefunction is slowly varying if R << a, which it usually is, but here we need to integrate.\n\nIn perturbation theory for finite size, we often assume that R is small, so e^{-2Z r / a} ≈ 1 for r near 0, since the exponential is approximately 1 when r is small.\n\nFor the 1s state, the probability density is constant near r=0, so for small R, we can approximate the integral.\n\nIn fact, for small R, the dominant contribution comes from the 1/r term in ΔV, but let's see.\n\nTypically, for finite size shift, the energy shift is proportional to the probability density at r=0 times the integral of ΔV, but ΔV has a 1/r behavior, so we need to be careful.\n\nLet's recall the standard result.\n\nI remember that for hydrogen-like atoms, the finite size energy shift for s-states is ΔE = (2π/5) |ψ(0)|^2 (Ze² R²) / (4πε₀ something), but let's derive it.\n\nIn our expression, we have terms with r, r², r⁴.\n\nSince R is small, and e^{-2Z r / a} ≈ 1 for r < R, because 2Z r / a << 1 if R << a/Z, which is true for light nuclei, but for large Z, it might not hold, but we'll assume the approximation.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, but in perturbation theory, we integrate as is.\n\nBut for the ratio, it might simplify.\n\nLet's define k = 2Z / a\n\nSo the integral I = ∫_0^R e^{-k r} [ r - (3/(2R)) r² + (1/(2R³)) r⁴ ] dr\n\nNow, for small kR, we can expand e^{-k r} ≈ 1 - k r + (k r)^2 / 2 - ... but since we have up to r^4, we need to keep terms.\n\nBut in standard treatment, for the 1s state, |ψ(0)|^2 = [1/π] (Z/a)^3\n\nAnd the energy shift is often given as ΔE = (2/5) (Ze² R²) / (4πε₀) * |ψ(0)|^2 * something.\n\nLet's compute the integral without approximation.\n\nSet u = k r, so r = u / k, dr = du / k\n\nThen I = ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ (u/k) - (3/(2R)) (u/k)^2 + (1/(2R³)) (u/k)^4 ] (du / k)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/k) ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ u/k - (3/(2R)) (u²/k²) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4/k^4) ] du / k? Let's see:\n\nr = u/k, dr = du/k\n\nSo I = ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ (u/k) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^2) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^4) ] (du / k)\n\n= ∫_0^{kR} e^{-u} [ (u / k^2) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^3) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^5) ] du\n\nNow k = 2Z/a, so k is large if Z is large or a is small.\n\nBut R is small, kR = (2Z/a) R\n\nNow R = r_0 A^{1/3}, a is Bohr radius, which for electron is about 5e-11 m, r_0 is about 1.2e-15 m, A^{1/3} for A=1 is 1, so R ~ 1e-15, a~5e-11, so R/a ~ 2e-5, so kR = 2Z R/a ~ 2Z * 2e-5 = 4e-5 Z, for Z=1, very small, for Z=100, 4e-3, still small. So kR << 1 for all practical purposes, so we can approximate the integral by the value at upper limit or expand.\n\nSince kR << 1, e^{-u} ≈ 1 for u from 0 to kR, so I ≈ ∫_0^{kR} [ (u / k^2) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^3) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^5) ] du\n\nBut the limits are from 0 to kR, and since kR small, we can integrate each term.\n\nBut let's keep it as is.\n\nSince e^{-u} ≈ 1, and the integral is from 0 to kR, so I ≈ ∫_0^{kR} [ r term etc.] but with u.\n\nFrom above:\n\nI ≈ ∫_0^{kR} [ (u / k^2) - (3/(2R)) (u^2 / k^3) + (1/(2R³)) (u^4 / k^5) ] du\n\nIntegrate:\n\n∫_0^{kR} u du = (1/2) u^2 |}_0^{kR} = (1/2) (kR)^2\n\n∫_0^{kR} u^2 du = (1/3) u^3 |}_0^{kR} = (1/3) (kR)^3\n\n∫_0^{kR} u^4 du = (1/5) u^5 |}_0^{kR} = (1/5) (kR)^5\n\nSo I ≈ [ (1/k^2) * (1/2) (kR)^2 ] - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 * (1/3) (kR)^3 ] + [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 * (1/5) (kR)^5 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: (1/k^2) * (1/2) k^2 R^2 = (1/2) R^2\n\nSecond term: - (3/(2R)) * (1/k^3) * (1/3) k^3 R^3 = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 * (k^3 / k^3) = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) R^2? Let's compute:\n\n(3/(2R)) / k^3 * (1/3) (kR)^3 = (3/(2R)) * (1/k^3) * (1/3) k^3 R^3 = (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (1/2) R^2? (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (3/3) * (1/2) R^{3-1} = 1 * (1/2) R^2 = (1/2) R^2\n\nBut there is a minus sign, so - [ (1/2) R^2 ] = - (1/2) R^2\n\nThird term: (1/(2R³)) / k^5 * (1/5) (kR)^5 = (1/(2R³)) * (1/k^5) * (1/5) k^5 R^5 = (1/(2R³)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2) (1/5) R^{5-3} = (1/10) R^2\n\n(1/(2R³)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2)(1/5) R^{2} = (1/10) R^2\n\nSo I ≈ [ (1/2) R^2 ] + [ - (1/2) R^2 ] + [ (1/10) R^2 ] = (1/2 - 1/2 + 1/10) R^2 = (0 + 1/10) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nI = ∫ ... du, and we have I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nBut let's check the terms:\n\nFirst term contributed + (1/2) R^2\n\nSecond term contributed - (1/2) R^2\n\nThird term contributed + (1/10) R^2\n\nSo total (1/2 - 1/2 + 1/10) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nNow, is this correct? I think I missed something.\n\nIn the integral, for the r term, which is the first one, it gave + (1/2) R^2, but let's see the coefficient.\n\nEarlier I had:\n\nI ≈ [ (u/k^2) term: ∫ (u/k^2) du from 0 to kR = (1/k^2) * (1/2) u^2 |_0^{kR} = (1/k^2) * (1/2) (kR)^2 = (1/2) R^2\n\nThen - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] ∫ u^2 du = - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] * (1/3) u^3 |_0^{kR} = - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] * (1/3) (kR)^3 = - [ (3/(2R)) / k^3 ] * (1/3) k^3 R^3 = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) R^2 * R? (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (3/3) (1/2) R^{3-1} = (1/2) R^2, yes - (1/2) R^2\n\nThen + [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] ∫ u^4 du = [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] * (1/5) u^5 |_0^{kR} = [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] * (1/5) (kR)^5 = [ (1/(2R³)) / k^5 ] * (1/5) k^5 R^5 = (1/(2R³)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2)(1/5) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nSo I ≈ 0 + 0 + (1/10) R^2? 1/2 - 1/2 + 1/10 = 1/10 R^2\n\nBut I recall that in the standard formula, there is a term.\n\nPerhaps the r term is important, but here it canceled with the r^2 term.\n\nIn ΔV, the 1/r term gives a singularity, but in the integral with r^2 dr, it becomes r dr, which is integrable.\n\nBut in this approximation, the leading term is from the r^4 part? No, we have (1/10) R^2.\n\nLet me compute the integral more carefully.\n\nFrom the expression, I = ∫_0^R e^{-k r} [ r - (3/(2R)) r^2 + (1/(2R^3)) r^4 ] dr\n\nFor small kR, e^{-k r} ≈ 1, so I ≈ ∫_0^R [ r - (3/(2R)) r^2 + (1/(2R^3)) r^4 ] dr\n\nCompute this integral:\n\n∫ r dr = (1/2) r^2 |}_0^R = (1/2) R^2\n\n∫ - (3/(2R)) r^2 dr = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) r^3 |}_0^R = - (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) R^2 * R? - (1/2) R^2? (3/(2R)) * (1/3) R^3 = (1/2) R^2, so - (1/2) R^2\n\n∫ (1/(2R^3)) r^4 dr = (1/(2R^3)) * (1/5) r^5 |}_0^R = (1/(2R^3)) * (1/5) R^5 = (1/2)(1/5) R^2 = (1/10) R^2\n\nSo I ≈ (1/2 R^2) - (1/2 R^2) + (1/10 R^2) = (1/10) R^2\n\nBut this can't be right because the r and r^2 terms canceled, leaving only the r^4 term which is small, but I think I have a mistake.\n\nIn ΔV, the constant term is there.\n\nLet's go back to ΔV.\n\nΔV(r) = (Ze²)/(4πε₀) [ -3/(2R) + r^2/(2R^3) + 1/r ]\n\nThen in the integral for ΔE, we have ψ^2 ΔV, and ψ^2 is proportional to e^{-2Z r / a}, but at r=0, it's constant.\n\nWhen we multiply by r^2 dr, for the 1/r term in ΔV, it becomes r dr, which is fine.\n\nBut in the expression above, for the integral ∫ ψ^2 ΔV r^2 dr, the term with 1/r in ΔV gives ∫ ψ^2 (1/r) r^2 dr = ∫ ψ^2 r dr, which for small r, ψ^2 is constant, so it's like ∫ r dr from 0 to R, which is (1/2) R^2.\n\nSimilarly, the constant term in ΔV, -3/(2R), gives ∫ ψ^2 (-3/(2R)) r^2 dr, which for small R, ψ^2 constant, so -3/(2R) * constant * ∫ r^2 dr = -3/(2R) * const * (1/3) R^3 = - (1/2) const R^2\n\nAnd the r^2 term in ΔV gives ∫ ψ^2 (r^2/(2R^3)) r^2 dr = ∫ ψ^2 (1/(2R^3)) r^4 dr ≈ const * (1/(2R^3)) * (1/5) R^5 = const * (1/10) R^2\n\nSo all terms are proportional to R^2, and with the constants, we got (1/10) R^2 for the integral part.\n\nBut in my calculation, the first two terms canceled, leaving only the third.\n\nBut I think the standard result for finite size shift is ΔE = (2/5) * (Ze^2 R^2) / (4πε₀) * |ψ(0)|^2 for s-states.\n\nLet me recall.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 for 1s is (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\nStandard formula: for a uniform sphere, the energy shift for s-state is ΔE = (2/5) π (Ze^2) R^2 |ψ(0)|^2 / (4πε₀) or something.\n\nI think I have a factor missing.\n\nLet's look back at my expression for ΔE.\n\nFrom earlier, ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * I\n\nAnd I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Z/a)^3 is related to |ψ(0)|^2.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 = [1/π] (Z/a)^3, so (Z/a)^3 = π |ψ(0)|^2\n\nSo ΔE = π |ψ(0)|^2 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * (1/10) R^2 = |ψ(0)|^2 * (Ze^2)/(ε₀) * (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(ε₀) , but usually we have 4πε₀.\n\nI think I missed the 4π.\n\nLet's check the constant.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * I\n\nWith I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) , and ε₀ is permittivity, but in cgs or SI, I need to be careful.\n\nIn atomic physics, often e^2 is used for e^2/(4πε₀), but in the problem, it's written with 4πε₀, so I should keep it.\n\nIn the potential, V = - (1/(4πε₀)) Ze^2 / r, so e here is the charge, and 4πε₀ is there.\n\nSo in my expression, I have (Ze^2)/(4πε₀) in ΔV, but in the constant for ΔE, I had:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) * I\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(π ε₀) , but (Ze^2)/(4πε₀) is the common combination.\n\nLet's see:\n\nI had ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * (Ze^2)/(πε₀) * I\n\nBut (Ze^2)/(πε₀) = 4 * (Ze^2)/(4πε₀)\n\nBecause 1/ε₀ = 4π / (4π ε₀) * 4π? 1/ε₀ = 4π k, with k=1/(4πε₀), but let's write:\n\n(Ze^2)/(πε₀) = (Ze^2)/π * 1/ε₀ = (Ze^2)/π * 4π / (4π ε₀) * 4π? 1/ε₀ = 4π * (1/(4πε₀)) = 4π k, where k=1/(4πε₀)\n\nSo (Ze^2)/(πε₀) = (Ze^2)/π * 4π k = 4 Ze^2 k\n\nWith k=1/(4πε₀)\n\nSimilarly, (Ze^2)/(4πε₀) = k Ze^2\n\nSo (Ze^2)/(πε₀) = 4 k Ze^2\n\nNow, I ≈ (1/10) R^2\n\nSo ΔE = (Z/a)^3 * 4 k Ze^2 * (1/10) R^2\n\nBut (Z/a)^3 = π |ψ(0)|^2, since |ψ(0)|^2 = (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\nSo ΔE = π |ψ(0)|^2 * 4 k Ze^2 * (1/10) R^2 = 4π |ψ(0)|^2 k Ze^2 (1/10) R^2\n\nNow k Ze^2 is (Ze^2)/(4πε₀)\n\nBut the standard formula is often ΔE = (2/5) (Ze^2 R^2) / (4πε₀) |ψ(0)|^2 for uniform sphere.\n\n(2/5) k Ze^2 R^2 |ψ(0)|^2\n\nBut here I have 4π (1/10) = 4π/10 = 2π/5\n\n4π/10 = 2π/5, and 2π/5 vs 2/5, I have an extra π.\n\n2π/5 vs 2/5, so I missed a factor.\n\nI think I know where.\n\nIn the integral, when I approximated, I got I = (1/10) R^2, but let's compute the integral without approximation for small R.\n\nFrom the expression, the energy shift can be written as.\n\nAnother way: the perturbation ΔV, and for s-state, the shift is proportional to the average of ΔV.\n\nBut let's calculate the integral I defined.\n\nI = ∫_0^R e^{-k r} [ r - (3/(2R)) r^2 + (1/(2R^3)) r^4 ] dr\n\nWith k = 2Z/a\n\nFor small kR, e^{-k r} = 1 - k r + (k r)^2 / 2 - (k r)^3 / 6 + ...\n\nBut since we have terms up to r^4, we need to expand.\n\nPerhaps the constant term in the brackets is missing.\n\nLet's list the terms in the brackets: r, - (3/(2R)) r^2, + (1/(2R^3)) r^4\n\nWhen we integrate with e^{-k r}, the leading term for small R is from the r term, because it's the lowest power.\n\nFor example, the r term: ∫_0^R e^{-k r} r dr\n\nFor small kR, ≈ ∫_0^R r dr = (1/2) R^2\n\nBut if kR is not zero, ∫_0^R e^{-k r} r dr = [ - (r/k) e^{-k r} - (1/k^2) e^{-k r} ] from 0 to R or something.\n\nLet's compute the antiderivative.\n\n∫ e^{-k r} r dr = - (r/k) e^{-k r} - ∫ - (1/k) e^{-k r} dr = - (r/k) e^{-k r} + (1/k) ∫ e^{-k r} dr = - (r/k) e^{-k r} - (1/k^2) e^{-k r} + c\n\nSo at r=R, - (R/k) e^{-k R} - (1/k^2) e^{-k R}\n\nAt r=0, - (0) - (1/k^2) (1) = -1/k^2\n\nSo ∫_0^R e^{-k r} r dr = [ - (R/k) e^{-k R} - (1/k^2) e^{-k R} ] - [ -1/k^2 ] = - (R/k) e^{-k R} - (1/k^2) e^{-k R} + 1/k^2\n\nFor small kR, e^{-k R} ≈ 1 - kR + (kR)^2/2 - ..., so - (R/k) (1 - kR + (kR)^2/2) - (1/k^2) (1 - kR + (kR)^2/2) + 1/k^2 = - (R/k) + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 / k? - (R/k) (1) + (R/k)(kR) - (R/k)(k^2 R^2)/2 + ... - (1/k^2) + (1/k^2)(kR) - (1/k^2)(k^2 R^2)/2 + 1/k^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n- (R/k) + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 * (1/k)? - (R/k) * (k^2 R^2)/2 / k no\n\n- (R/k) * 1 = - R/k\n\n- (R/k) * (- kR) = + (R/k)(kR) = + R^2? from e^{-kR} ≈ 1 - kR + (k^2 R^2)/2 - ...\n\nSo - (R/k) * (1 - kR + (k^2 R^2)/2 - ...) = - (R/k) + (R/k)(kR) - (R/k)(k^2 R^2)/2 + ... = - R/k + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 * k? (R/k) * (k^2 R^2)/2 = R * k R^2 /2 = (k R^3)/2\n\nLet's write:\n\n- (R/k) * 1 = - R/k\n\n- (R/k) * (- kR) = - (R/k) (-kR) = + (R/k)(kR) = + R^2\n\n- (R/k) * ( (k^2 R^2)/2 ) = - (R/k) (k^2 R^2)/2 = - (k R^3)/2\n\nSimilarly, - (1/k^2) e^{-kR} = - (1/k^2) (1 - kR + (k^2 R^2)/2 - ...) = -1/k^2 + (1/k^2)(kR) - (1/k^2)(k^2 R^2)/2 + ... = -1/k^2 + R/k - (R^2)/2\n\nThen +1/k^2 from the lower limit.\n\nSo total for ∫ r e^{-kr} dr from 0 to R:\n\nFrom above: - R/k + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 + ... + [ -1/k^2 + R/k - R^2/2 + ... ] + 1/k^2\n\nSimplify: - R/k + R^2 - (k R^3)/2 -1/k^2 + R/k - R^2/2 + 1/k^2 + higher order\n\nNow - R/k + R/k = 0\n\n-1/k^2 + 1/k2 = 0\n\nR^2 - R^2/2 = (1/2) R^2\n\n- (k R^3)/2 + higher order\n\nSo for small kR, ≈ (1/2) R^2 - (k R^3)/2 + ...\n\nSimilarly, for other terms.\n\nBut in our case, for the r term in the brackets, it's part of I.\n\nBut in I, we have also the other terms.\n\nFor the finite size shift, the main contribution comes from the 1/r part of ΔV, which gives the r term in the brackets.\n\nIn the standard derivation, for the uniform sphere, the energy shift is ΔE = (2/5) (Ze^2 R^2) / (4πε₀) |ψ(0)|^2\n\nLet me assume that for now.\n\nFor example, in hydrogen, for electron, it's small.\n\nSo for a particle, ΔE proportional to |ψ(0)|^2 R^2\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 for 1s state is proportional to (Z/a)^3, and a is the Bohr radius, which depends on the reduced mass.\n\nBohr radius a = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (μ e^2), where μ is the reduced mass.\n\nFor electron, μ ≈ m_e, so a_e = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_e e^2)\n\nFor muon, μ ≈ m_μ, so a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_μ e^2)\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 = (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\nSo for a given nucleus, Z and R are the same for both electron and muon.\n\nR is the same, since it's the nucleus radius.\n\nThe energy shift ΔE_e for electron proportional to |ψ(0)|_e^2 R^2\n\nSimilarly for muon, ΔE_μ proportional to |ψ(0)|_μ^2 R^2\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 proportional to (Z/a)^3, and a proportional to 1/μ, since a = constant / μ\n\nFrom a = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (μ e^2), so a ∝ 1/μ\n\nTherefore |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ (Z / a)^3 ∝ (Z * μ)^3, since a ∝ 1/μ, so 1/a ∝ μ\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ μ^3\n\nTherefore ΔE ∝ |ψ(0)|^2 R^2 ∝ μ^3 R^2\n\nBut R is the same for both, so ΔE ∝ μ^3\n\nThus for muon and electron, ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nBut μ ≈ mass of the particle, since nucleus is heavy, so μ_μ = m_μ, μ_e = m_e\n\nm_μ = 207 m_e, so (m_μ / m_e)^3 = (207)^3\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nIn the ratio, R and Z are the same, so yes.\n\nBut in the energy shift, is it proportional to μ^3?\n\nFrom the standard formula, ΔE = constant * |ψ(0)|^2 R^2, and |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ (μ)^3, so ΔE ∝ μ^3.\n\nFor muon, since m_μ >> m_e, a_μ is smaller, so |ψ(0)|^2 is larger, so the shift is larger.\n\nThe ratio should be (m_μ / m_e)^3 = 207^3.\n\nBut is this for the point nucleus wavefunction? Yes, perturbation theory.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"using first-order perturbation theory with the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus\", so yes.\n\nNow, but in my earlier calculation, I had a discrepancy with the factor.\n\nPerhaps for the ratio, the constant cancels.\n\nLet's confirm with the formula.\n\nThe ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [ |ψ(0)|_μ^2 ] / [ |ψ(0)|_e^2 ] since R and other constants same.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 for 1s is (1/π) (Z/a)^3\n\na = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (μ e^2)\n\nSo for electron, a_e = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_e e^2)\n\nFor muon, a_μ = (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_μ e^2)\n\nSo |ψ(0)|_e^2 = (1/π) (Z / a_e)^3\n\n|ψ(0)|_μ^2 = (1/π) (Z / a_μ)^3\n\nSo ratio |ψ(0)|_μ^2 / |ψ(0)|_e^2 = [ (Z / a_μ)^3 ] / [ (Z / a_e)^3 ] = (a_e / a_μ)^3\n\nBut a_e / a_μ = [ (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_e e^2) ] / [ (4πε₀ ħ^2) / (m_μ e^2) ] = m_μ / m_e\n\nSince m_μ = 207 m_e\n\nSo a_e / a_μ = m_μ / m_e = 207\n\nTherefore |ψ(0)|_μ^2 / |ψ(0)|_e^2 = (207)^3\n\nThus ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (207)^3\n\nBut ΔE is proportional to |ψ(0)|^2, so ratio is (207)^3.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of energy shifts, and to express in terms of the parameters, but since it's simplified, and 207 is given.\n\nm_μ = 207 m_e, so it's fine.\n\nBut is there any dependence on Z or A? In this ratio, Z and A cancel out, because R is the same, and in |ψ(0)|^2, Z is the same, but in the ratio, Z cancels, and R cancels.\n\nIn ΔE ∝ |ψ(0)|^2 R^2, and |ψ(0)|^2 ∝ Z^3, R ∝ A^{1/3}, but in the ratio, for the same atom, Z and A are fixed, so for different particles, Z and A are same, so only the mass ratio matters.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the ratio should be (m_μ / m_e)^3 = 207^3.\n\nBut let's confirm the energy shift formula.\n\nI think I have a mistake because in my initial integral, I got a factor, but for the ratio, it cancels.\n\nPerhaps the standard factor is included.\n\nAnother thing: in the perturbation, for the finite size, the shift is indeed proportional to R^2 |ψ(0)|^2 for s-states.\n\nFor example, in quantum mechanics books.\n\nSo for the ratio, ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = [ |ψ(0)|_μ^2 ] / [ |ψ(0)|_e^2 ] = (a_e / a_μ)^3 = (m_μ / m_e)^3\n\nSince a ∝ 1/μ.\n\nSo (207)^3.\n\nBut the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\", but in this case, the ratio is just (m_μ / m_e)^3, which is 207^3, but since m_μ and m_e are given, we can write it as (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nFundamental constants are not needed since it's a ratio.\n\nBut let's see the answer should be a number, but with the masses.\n\nm_μ = 207 m_e, so it's fine.\n\nBut in the box, we need to write the expression.\n\nThe ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nIn the wavefunction, the Bohr radius depends on the reduced mass.\n\nFor electron, reduced mass μ_e = m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ≈ m_e since M_nuc >> m_e.\n\nSimilarly for muon, m_μ = 207 m_e, but M_nuc is still much larger, since nucleus mass is at least proton mass, which is about 1836 m_e, and m_μ = 207 m_e, so M_nuc min is about 1836 m_e for hydrogen, but for larger A, larger.\n\nFor hydrogen, Z=1, A=1, M_nuc = m_p ≈ 1836 m_e, m_μ = 207 m_e, so M_nuc / m_μ ≈ 1836 / 207 ≈ 8.87, so about 9 times, not much larger, but still, reduced mass μ_μ = m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) = m_μ / (1 + m_μ/M_nuc) ≈ m_μ (1 - m_μ/M_nuc)\n\nSimilarly for electron, μ_e ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M_nuc)\n\nBut in the ratio, it might have a small correction.\n\nHowever, in the problem, it says \"using the unperturbed hydrogen-like wavefunctions for a point nucleus\", and typically, for hydrogen-like, we use the reduced mass.\n\nBut in the wavefunction, a = 4πε₀ ħ^2 / (μ e^2), with μ reduced mass.\n\nBut for the ratio, if we include reduced mass.\n\nLet μ_e be reduced mass for electron system: μ_e = m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc)\n\nμ_μ for muon: μ_μ = m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nThen a_e = 4πε₀ ħ^2 / (μ_e e^2)\n\na_μ = 4πε₀ ħ^2 / (μ_μ e^2)\n\nThen |ψ(0)|^2 proportional to (μ)^3, since a ∝ 1/μ, so (1/a) ∝ μ.\n\n|ψ(0)|^2 ∝ μ^3\n\nThus ΔE ∝ μ^3 R^2\n\nR same, so ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nNow μ_μ / μ_e = [ m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ] = [ m_μ / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / m_e ]\n\n= (m_μ / m_e) * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]\n\nM_nuc is the nuclear mass, which is proportional to A, since mass number.\n\nM_nuc ≈ A m_p, with m_p proton mass.\n\nBut in terms of the given, A is given.\n\nIn the ratio, we have (m_μ / m_e) * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]\n\nSince M_nuc >> m_e, m_e + M_nuc ≈ M_nuc\n\nm_μ + M_nuc ≈ M_nuc if M_nuc >> m_μ, but for light nuclei, not necessarily.\n\nFor example, for hydrogen, M_nuc = m_p ≈ 1836 m_e, m_μ = 207 m_e, so m_μ / M_nuc ≈ 207/1836 ≈ 0.112, so not negligible.\n\nSimilarly, m_e / M_nuc negligible.\n\nSo (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ≈ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nAnd M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) = 1 / (m_μ/M_nuc + 1)\n\nSimilarly, μ_μ / μ_e ≈ (m_μ / m_e) * [ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ M_nuc / M_nuc ] since μ_e ≈ m_e, but with reduced mass.\n\nFrom above:\n\nμ_μ / μ_e = (m_μ / m_e) * [ (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] ≈ (m_μ / m_e) * [ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] since m_e negligible\n\nAnd M_nuc = A m_N, where m_N is nucleon mass, but we can write in terms of A.\n\nThe problem gives mass number A, so M_nuc ∝ A.\n\nSpecifically, M_nuc = u A, where u is atomic mass unit, but u is proportional to m_p, etc.\n\nBut in the expression, we have M_nuc.\n\nBut the problem asks to express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants.\n\nFundamental constants include ħ, c, etc., but here we have M_nuc.\n\nM_nuc is not given directly, but we can use A.\n\nSince M_nuc ∝ A, and the nucleon mass is constant, but in the ratio, we need the actual mass.\n\nPerhaps we can write M_nuc = A m_p, but m_p is not given, it's a fundamental constant.\n\nm_p is the proton mass.\n\nBut the problem says \"fundamental constants\", so we can use m_p or something.\n\nTo avoid, perhaps in the approximation, since for most atoms, M_nuc >> m_μ, so μ_μ ≈ m_μ, μ_e ≈ m_e, so ratio (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nBut for precision, let's include.\n\nThe ratio ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nWith μ_μ = m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nμ_e = m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc)\n\nSo (μ_μ / μ_e) = [ m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ] = (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nNow M_nuc is the nuclear mass, which is approximately A times the proton mass, but since A is given, and proton mass is fundamental, but we can write.\n\nIn the context, r_0 is given, which is used for R, but R cancels in ratio.\n\nSimilarly, Z cancels.\n\nSo the ratio is (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nM_nuc = mass of nucleus.\n\nThe mass number A is given, so M_nuc = A u, where u is the atomic mass unit, but u = m_p approximately, since proton mass.\n\nTo be precise, we can use A and the proton mass.\n\nBut the problem says \"express in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\", so fundamental constants include the proton mass or atomic mass unit.\n\nSince M_nuc appears, we need to include it.\n\nIn the expression, (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) can be written as 1 / [ (m_μ + M_nuc) / (m_e + M_nuc) ] but not helpful.\n\nLet's write the ratio as:\n\nΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3 = [ (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ]^3\n\nM_nuc = A m_p, where m_p is the proton mass.\n\nSo = [ (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + A m_p) / (m_μ + A m_p) ]^3\n\nm_p is a fundamental constant.\n\nSince m_μ = 207 m_e, we can write in terms of m_e and m_μ.\n\nBut A and m_p are there.\n\nPerhaps for the ratio, since M_nuc >> m_e, we approximate (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc) ≈ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) = 1 / (m_μ/M_nuc + 1)\n\nAnd m_μ/M_nuc = m_μ/(A m_p)\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nI think in most contexts, for muonic atoms, the finite size shift is larger because of the reduced Bohr radius, and the reduced mass effect is secondary.\n\nBut to be accurate, let's see what the problem expects.\n\nThe problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and \"in terms of Z, A, r_0, m_e, m_μ, and fundamental constants\".\n\nFundamental constants include ħ, c, e, m_p, etc.\n\nBut in the ratio, many cancel.\n\nPerhaps we can assume M_nuc >> m_μ, so μ_μ ≈ m_μ, μ_e ≈ m_e, so ratio (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nIn the initial statement, for the muon, since m_μ = 207 m_e, and for light nuclei, M_nuc is not much larger, but for heavy nuclei, it is.\n\nFor example, for lead, A=207, M_nuc ≈ 207 * 1836 m_e, so m_μ/M_nuc = 207 m_e / (207*1836 m_e) = 1/1836, very small, so μ_μ ≈ m_μ.\n\nSimilarly for electron, μ_e ≈ m_e.\n\nFor hydrogen, it's less accurate, but perhaps the problem assumes the approximation.\n\nIn the perturbation theory, the wavefunction is for point nucleus with reduced mass, so we should include it.\n\nBut let's look for the energy shift expression.\n\nI recall that the first-order energy shift for finite size is:\n\nΔE = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\left( \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\right) R^2 |\\psi(0)|^2\n\nFor s-states.\n\nWith |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z \\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} ? Let's see.\n\na = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2}, so \\frac{Z}{a} = Z \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{Z \\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} ? No.\n\nψ(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (Z/a)^{3/2} e^{-Zr/a}\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (Z/a)^{3/2} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (Z/a)^3\n\nAnd a = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{\\mu e^2}, so (1/a) = \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}\n\nSo |ψ(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} Z^3 \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nThen ΔE = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} R^2 \\frac{1}{\\pi} Z^3 \\left( \\frac{\\mu e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2} \\right)^3\n\nSimplify.\n\nFor the ratio, ΔE_μ / ΔE_e, all terms are the same except μ.\n\nSpecifically, ΔE proportional to μ^3, because of the (μ e^2)^3 term.\n\nFrom above, ΔE ∝ μ^3 R^2, and R same, so ΔE ∝ μ^3.\n\nThus ΔE_μ / ΔE_e = (μ_μ / μ_e)^3\n\nWith μ_μ and μ_e as reduced masses.\n\nNow for the ratio, we have.\n\nBut in the problem, it asks for the ratio, and to express in terms of the parameters.\n\nPerhaps we can write the ratio as (m_μ / m_e)^3 times a correction factor.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince the nucleus is the same, M_nuc is fixed.\n\nSo μ_μ / μ_e = [ m_μ M_nuc / (m_μ + M_nuc) ] / [ m_e M_nuc / (m_e + M_nuc) ] = (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + M_nuc) / (m_μ + M_nuc)\n\nM_nuc = A m_p, with m_p proton mass.\n\nSo the ratio is [ (m_μ / m_e) * (m_e + A m_p) / (m_μ + A m_p) ]^3\n\nNow m_p is a fundamental constant.\n\nIn the expression, we can write it.\n\nBut the problem might expect the simple form.\n\nAnother thing: in the energy shift, for the finite size, the formula I used assumes that the wavefunction is constant over the nucleus, which is valid when R << a, but for muon, a is smaller, so for heavy nuclei, R/a might not be small, but in perturbation theory, we still use the point nucleus wavefunction.\n\nFor the ratio, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since it's first-order perturbation, and for the ratio, the simple form is accepted.\n\nLet's assume that the reduced mass effect is negligible, so μ_μ = m_μ, μ_e = m_e, so ratio (m_μ/m_e)^3.\n\nThen the ratio is 207^3.\n\nBut to write it.\n\nThe problem says \"express in terms of ...\", so perhaps we need to include the masses.\n\nIn the Final-Box-Only, we need to put the expression.\n\nPerhaps the ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nBut let's see if there is Z or A dependence.\n\nFrom the expression, no.\n\nr_0 is for R, but R cancels.\n\nSo I think the ratio is (m_μ / m_e)^3.\n\nSo for the box, we can put \\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}\n\nBut m_μ and m_e are given, so it's fine.\n\nTo be precise, with fundamental constants, but it's a ratio.\n\nPerhaps they want the expression.\n\nAnother thought: in the perturbation, for the muon, since the Bohr radius is smaller, the approximation e^{-k r} ≈ 1 may not be as good for large Z, but for the ratio, it might cancel.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, I got a factor, but for the ratio, it should be the same.\n\nSo I think (m_μ / m_e)^3 is correct.\n\nSo the ratio \\frac{\\Delta E_\\mu}{\\Delta E_e} = \\left( \\frac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}\n\nSo for the box, we put that.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nIn the FBO protocol, only the expression.\n\nSo \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{m_{\\mu}}{m_{e}} \\right)^{3}}\n\nBut m_μ and m_e are symbols, so it should be fine.\n\nTo include the reduced mass, but I think for this problem, it's not necessary.\n\nThe problem says \"simplified to a closed-form expression\", and with the masses given, it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n",
