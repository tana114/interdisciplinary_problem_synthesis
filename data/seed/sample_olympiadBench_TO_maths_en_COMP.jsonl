Thus, Sergey is able to identify $a_{17}, a_{18}$, and $a_{19}$, and thence the residue of $N$ modulo $17 \\\\cdot 18 \\\\cdot 19=5814>5000$, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

First, we note a key property:\\n\\n\\n\\nClaim (Sign of $f$ ). $f$ attains wither only nonnegative values, or only nonpositive values.\\n\\n\\n\\nProof. This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\\\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe strategy for showing $\\\\operatorname{deg} f \\\\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\\\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\\\left(A_{1}, \\\\ldots, A_{2 n}\\\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero).

Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\\n\\n\\n\\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\\\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\\\operatorname{deg} f \\\\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\\n\\n\\n\\n$$\\nf\\\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\\\ldots, A_{2 n}\\\\right)=g\\\\left(A_{1}-\\\\bar{A}, \\\\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\\\bar{A}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere $\\\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\\\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n<img_3624>\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\\\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\\\max \\\\left(d_{1}, \\\\ldots, d_{m}\\\\right)$.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\\\left|A_{i}\\\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal.

By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\\\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\\\ldots, n$.\\n\\n\\n\\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\\\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\\\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\\\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\\\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\\\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\\\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\\\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\\\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. Finally, the centroid-shifting trick gives a polynomial which works in general, as wanted.\"]","answer":"['$2n$']","subject":"Math","subfield":"Algebra"}

Adjunction of the arrow $a_{k} \\\\rightarrow a_{k+1}$ to $\\\\mathcal{C}^{\\\\prime}$ yields a unique good configuration on $2 n$ points, as required.'\n 'Use the counterclockwise labelling $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{2 n}$ in the solution above.\\n\\nLetting $D_{n}$ be the number of good configurations on $2 n$ points, we establish a recurrence relation for the $D_{n}$. To this end, let $C_{n}=\\\\frac{(2 n) !}{n !(n+1) !}$ the $n$th Catalan number; it is well-known that $C_{n}$ is the number of ways to connect $2 n$ given points on the circumference by $n$ pairwise disjoint chords.\\n\\nSince no two arrows cross, in any good configuration the vertex $a_{1}$ is connected to some $a_{2 k}$. Fix $k$ in the range 1 through $n$ and count the number of good configurations containing the arrow $a_{1} \\\\rightarrow a_{2 k}$. Let $\\\\mathcal{C}$ be any such configuration.\\n\\nIn $\\\\mathcal{C}$, the vertices $a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{2 k-1}$ are paired off with one other, each arrow pointing from the smaller to the larger index, for otherwise it would form a prohibited quadrangle with $a_{1} \\\\rightarrow a_{2 k}$.

An orientation of the chords in a Catalan configuration $\\\\mathcal{C}$ making it into a good configuration (in the sense defined in the statement of the problem) will be referred to as a good orientation for $\\\\mathcal{C}$.\\n\\nWe show by induction on $n$ that there are exactly $n+1$ good orientations for any Catalan $n$-configuration, so there are exactly $(n+1) C_{n}=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c}2 n \\\\\\\\ n\\\\end{array}\\\\right)$ good configurations on $2 n$ points.

This completes the induction step and ends the proof.\\n\\n### solution_3\\nWe intend to count the number of good orientations of a Catalan $n$-configuration.\\n\\nFor each such configuration, we consider its dual graph $T$ whose vertices are finite regions bounded by chords and the circle, and an edge connects two regions sharing a boundary segment. This graph $T$ is a plane tree with $n$ edges and $n+1$ vertices.\\n\\nThere is a canonical bijection between orientations of chords and orientations of edges of $T$ in such a way that each chord crosses an edge of $T$ from the right to the left of the arrow on that edge. A good orientation of chords corresponds to an orientation of the tree containing no two edges oriented towards each other. Such an orientation is defined uniquely by its source vertex, i.e., the unique vertex having no in-arrows.\\n\\nTherefore, for each tree $T$ on $n+1$ vertices, there are exactly $n+1$ ways to orient it so that the source vertex is unique - one for each choice of the source.

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length $m-1$ at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board. Colour the cells of the board chess-like and notice that in each of the two triangular regions the number of black cells and the number of white cells differ by $\\\\lfloor m \/ 2\\\\rfloor$.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf $\\\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

For $0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\\n\\n\\n\\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal.

Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\\n\\n\\n\\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\\\lfloor m \/ 2\\\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\\\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty.
