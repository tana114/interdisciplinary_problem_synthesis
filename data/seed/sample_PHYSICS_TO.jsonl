However as the electron is negatively charged, $\\mu_e$ is antiparallel to the electron spin angular momentum $s_e$. For the lowest energy state of $H_{\\text{int}}$, $\\langle \\mu_p \\cdot \\mu_e \\rangle > 0$, and so $\\langle s_p \\cdot s_e \\rangle < 0$.

For the spin triplet state ($S = 1$, symmetric) the rotational state must have $J = 1, 3, \\ldots$, with the ground state having $J = 1$.

Explain these facts.","solution":"(a) The reason why heavy nuclei only are $\\alpha$-radioactive has been discussed in *Problems 2033 and 2034*. For ordinary nuclei near the $\\beta$-stability curve, the binding energy of the last neutron is positive so that no neutron-radioactivity exists naturally. However, for neutron-rich isotopes far from the $\\beta$-stability curve, the binding energy may be negative for the last neutron, and so neutron-emission may occur spontaneously. As there is no Coulomb barrier for neutrons, emission is a transient process. Also, certain excited states arising from $\\beta$-decays may emit neutrons. In such cases, as the neutron-emission follows a $\\beta$-decay the emitted neutrons are called delayed neutrons. The half-life against delayed-neutron emission is the same as that against the related $\\beta$-decay.\n\n(b) There are two categories of methods for measuring nuclear radii. The first category makes use of the range of the strong interaction of nuclear forces by studying the scattering by nuclei of neutrons, protons or $\\alpha$-particles, particularly by measuring the total cross-section of intermediate-energy neutrons. Such methods give the nuclear radius as\n\n$$\nR = R_0 A^{1\/3}, \\quad R_0 \\approx (1.4 \\sim 1.5) \\, \\text{fm}.\n$$\n\nThe other category of methods makes use of the Coulomb interaction between charged particles and atomic nuclei or that among particles within a nucleus to get the electromagnetic nuclear radius. By studying the scattering between high energy electrons and atomic nuclei, the form factors of the nuclei may be deduced which gives the electromagnetic nuclear radius. Assuming mirror nuclei to be of the same structure, their mass difference is caused by Coulomb energy difference and the mass difference between neutron and proton. We have (*Problem 2010*)\n\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{e^2}{R} (2Z - 1) - (m_n - m_p)c^2\n$$\n\nfor the energy difference between the ground states of the mirror nuclei, which then gives the electromagnetic nuclear radius $R$. A more precise\n\nmethod is to study the deviation of $\\mu$-mesic atom from Bohr's model of hydrogen atom. Because the Bohr radius of the mesic atom is much smaller than that of the hydrogen atom, the former is more sensitive to the value of the electromagnetic nuclear radius, which, by this method, is\n\n$$\nR = R_0 A^{1\/3}, \\quad R_0 \\approx 1.1 \\, \\text{fm}.\n$$\n\nHigh-energy electron scattering experiments show that charge distribution within a nucleus is nonuniform.\n\n(c) The ground state of a system of nucleons is identified by its spin, parity and isospin quantum numbers.\n\nSpin and parity are determined by those of the last one or two unpaired nucleons. For the ground state of an even-even nucleus, $J^p = 0^+$. For an even-odd nucleus, the nuclear spin and parity are determined by the last nucleon, and for an odd-odd nucleus, by the spin-orbit coupling of the last two nucleons.\n\nThe isospin of the nuclear ground state is $I = \\frac{1}{2}|N - Z|$.\n\n(d) There is a fission barrier of about 6 MeV for uranium so that spontaneous fission is unlikely and external inducement is required. At the same time, there is a tendency for neutrons in a nucleus to pair up so that isotopes with even numbers of neutrons, $N$, have higher binding energies. When an uranium isotope with an odd number of neutrons captures a neutron and becomes an isotope of even $N$, the excitation energy of the compound nucleus is large, sufficient to overcome the fission barrier, and fission occurs. On the other hand, when an even-$N$ uranium isotope captures a neutron to become an isotope of odd $N$, the excitation energy of the compound nucleus is small, not sufficient to overcome the fission barrier, and fission does not take place. For example, in $^{235}U + n \\rightarrow {}^{236}U^*$ the excitation energy of the compound nucleus $^{236}U^*$ is 6.4 MeV, higher than the fission barrier of ${236}U$ of 5.9 MeV, so the probability of this reaction results in a fission is large. In $^{238}U + n \\rightarrow {}^{239}U^*$, the excitation energy is only 4.8 MeV, lower than the fission barrier of 6.2 MeV of $^{239}U$, and so the probability for fission is low. Such nuclides require neutrons of higher energies to achieve fission. When the neutron energy is higher than a certain threshold, fission cross section becomes large and fission may occur.\n\nThermal neutrons, which can cause fission when captured by odd-$N$ uranium isotopes, have long wavelengths and hence large capture cross sections. Thus the cross sections for fission induced by thermal neutrons are large, in hundreds of barns, for uranium isotopes of odd $N$. They are small for isotope of even $N$.\n\nIf a fast neutron is captured by an uranium isotope the excitation energy of the compound nucleus is larger than the fission barrier and fission occurs irrespective of whether the isotope has an even or an odd number of neu-trons. While fast neutrons have smaller probability of being captured their fission cross section, which is of the order of a few barns, do not change with the even-odd periodicity of the neutron number of the uranium isotope.","answer":["\\text{Heavy nuclei are }\\alpha\\text{-radioactive but stable against neutron-emission due to positive binding energy and Coulomb barrier absence.}","R = R_0 A^{1\/3}, \\quad R_0 \\approx (1.4 \\sim 1.5) \\, \\text{fm}","R = R_0 A^{1\/3}, \\quad R_0 \\approx 1.1 \\, \\text{fm}","I = \\frac{1}{2}|N - Z|","\\text{Thermal neutrons: large cross sections for odd-} N; \\text{ fast neutrons: no even-odd effects.}"],"subject":"Physics","subfield":"atomic"}
